# Lipidomics data processing

Tutorial Prerequisites: [Preparing and importing
data](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/tutorial-01-prep-data.md)

This tutorial follows a complete postprocessing and quality control
workflow for a targeted lipidomics analysis. Starting from integrated
peak areas, we work towards a curated table of lipid species
concentrations ready for statistical analysis. Along the way we assess
the analytical and data quality of the run, normalise and quantify
against internal standards, correct for run-order drift and
between-batch effects, filter features on QC criteria, and export the
result. The dataset (a longitudinal plasma study (`sPerfect`) measured
across six batches) is realistic enough to show the decisions a real
analysis demands.

## 1. Set up a project

A new analysis is easiest to manage inside an RStudio or Positron
project (see [Using RStudio
Projects](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects)
or the [Positron User Guide](https://positron.posit.co/)), with a
predictable folder layout that keeps the raw data, the exported results,
and the processing notebook apart:

    my_study/
    ├── data/           # raw data and metadata files
    ├── output/         # exported results
    └── analysis.Rmd    # your processing notebook

An R Notebook (`.Rmd`) or
[Quarto](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/documents/quarto-project.html)
(`.qmd`) document is a natural home for a workflow like this one: it
interleaves code with prose, keeping a record of every decision beside
the result it produced. With the project in place, load the package to
begin:

``` r

library(mrmhub)
```

## 2. Importing analysis results

We begin by importing the MRMhub result file, which holds the areas of
the integrated peaks (features) for every processed raw data file. The
same file also carries the peak retention times and widths and metadata
read from the mzML files, such as acquisition time stamps and
precursor/product m/z values; setting `import_metadata = TRUE` brings
those across as well. The imported data lands in the `dataset_orig` slot
and is copied to the working `dataset`. Printing the object at any stage
with `print(mexp)` reports its processing status, and in RStudio you can
expand `mexp` in the Environment pane.

``` r

mexp <- MRMhubExperiment(title = "sPerfect")
mexp <- import_data_mrmhub(
  mexp,
  path = "./datasets/sPerfect_MRMhub.tsv",
  import_metadata = TRUE
)
```

    ✔ Imported 499 analyses with 503 features.

    ℹ feature_area selected as default feature intensity. Modify with `set_intensity_var()`.

    ✔ Analysis metadata associated with 499 analyses.

    ✔ Feature metadata associated with 503 features.

## 3. A glimpse on the imported data

The data is stored in long format (one row per analysis–feature pair) so
each measurement carries its own area, retention time, and metadata side
by side. Print the working table below, or enter
`View(mexp@dataset_orig)` in the console to browse and filter it in the
RStudio viewer. For routine access it is cleaner to use
`get_analyticaldata(mexp, annotated = TRUE)`, which returns the same
data already joined to its sample and feature annotations.

``` r
print(mexp@dataset)

## 4. Analytical design and timeline

Before touching the signals, understand how the run was structured. The
plot below lays out the batch boundaries, the positions of the quality
control (QC) samples, and the date, duration, and run time of the
analysis: context that informs every later choice about drift, batches,
and which QC type to trust. Setting `show_timestamp = TRUE` overlays
acquisition times and reveals any long interruptions within or between
batches.

``` r

plot_runsequence(
  mexp,
  qc_types = NA,
  show_batches = TRUE,
  batch_zebra_stripe = TRUE,
  batch_fill_color = "#fffbdb",
  segment_linewidth = 0.5,
  show_timestamp = FALSE
)
```

![RunSequence plot of the analysis showing batches and QC
positions](tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow_files/figure-html/runsequence-1.png)

Figure 1. Run sequence of the analysis (batch structure, QC-sample
positions, and acquisition timeline).

## 5. Overview of chromatographic separation

A first look at the chromatography confirms that species elute where
expected. The plot shows the retention time distribution of all detected
lipid species across the study samples, arranged by class.

``` r

plot_abundanceprofile(
  mexp,
  variable = "rt",
  qc_types = "SPL",
  log_scale = FALSE,
  density_strip = TRUE,
  show_sum = FALSE,
  x_label = NA,
  feature_map = "lipidomics"
)
```

![Retention-time distribution of all detected lipid
species](tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow_files/figure-html/rt-overview-1.png)

Figure 2. Retention-time distribution of all detected lipid species
across the study samples.

## 6. Peak picking QC

Within a lipid class, retention time increases smoothly with chain
length and decreases with the number of double bonds, so plotting RT
against total carbon count (coloured by double-bond number) turns
peak-picking errors into visible outliers. Species whose residual from
the class trend exceeds `outlier_residual_min` are labelled, flagging
likely misannotations or mis-integrated peaks. The check is only as
strong as the coverage behind it: here just a few species per class were
measured, so the trend is poorly constrained for some classes and
double-bond counts.

``` r

plot_rt_vs_chain(
  mexp,
  qc_types = "SPL",
  x_var = "total_c",
  outlier_residual_min = 0.3,
  font_base_size = 8,
  point_size = 1
)
```

![Retention time versus carbon number per lipid class, outliers
labelled](tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow_files/figure-html/peak-picking-qc-1.png)

Figure 3. Retention time versus total carbon number per lipid class;
labelled points flag possible misannotations.

## 7. Signal trends of internal standards

The internal standards (ISTDs) are our clearest window on instrument
stability. The same ISTD amount was spiked into every sample except the
solvent blanks (`SBLK`), so in the absence of technical variation each
ISTD should read a constant intensity across all samples and sample
types. Plotting them in injection order across the six batches makes any
drift, batch offset, or blockage immediately visible. Setting
`output_pdf = TRUE` saves the plots to the `output` subfolder for closer
inspection.

``` r

plot_runscatter(
  mexp,
  variable = "intensity",
  qc_types = c("BQC", "TQC", "SPL", "PBLK", "SBLK"),
  include_feature_filter = "ISTD",
  exclude_feature_filter = "Hex|282",
  cap_outliers = TRUE,
  log_scale = FALSE,
  show_batches = TRUE,
  font_base_size = 5,
  output_pdf = FALSE,
  cols_page = 4, rows_page = 3
)
```

batches](tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow_files/figure-html/runscatter-istd-1.png)

spiked amount is constant, so a flat trend is expected.

spiked amount is constant, so a flat trend is expected.

## 8. Adding detailed metadata

Everything from here on (sample roles, ISTD assignments, spike amounts,
concentrations) comes from the analysis metadata. The MRMhub Excel
template collects, organises, and pre-validates it in one place; open
the `.xlsx` file in the `datasets` folder to see its structure. On
import the metadata is validated: a hard error (a duplicate or missing
ID) stops the import with a summary of the problems, while softer issues
are reported as warnings you can work through, or bypass with
`ignore_warnings = TRUE`. We then fix the processing order to the
injection sequence with
[`set_analysis_order()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/set_analysis_order.md),
and tell MRMhub which of the imported signal variables to treat as the
working feature intensity (`set_intensity_var("area")`), the value all
subsequent calculations start from.

``` r
mexp <- import_metadata_msorganiser(
  mexp,
  path = "datasets/sPerfect_Metadata.xlsx",
  ignore_warnings = TRUE
)
Found no errors, 4 warnings, and no notes in the metadata.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

    ✔ Analysis metadata associated with 499 analyses.

    ✔ Feature metadata associated with 502 features.

    ✔ Internal Standard metadata associated with 17 ISTDs.

    ✔ Response curve metadata associated with 12 annotated analyses.

``` r

mexp <- set_analysis_order(mexp, order_by = "timestamp")
```

    ✔ Analysis order set to "timestamp"

``` r

mexp <- set_intensity_var(mexp, variable_name = "area")
```

    ✔ Default feature intensity variable set to "feature_area"

## 9. Overall trends and possible outliers

To judge technical trends that affect most analytes at once, the RLA
(Relative Log Abundance) plot is the tool of choice (De Livera et al.,
Analytical Chemistry, 2015). Each feature is expressed relative to its
across- or within-batch median and summarised as one boxplot per sample;
a well-behaved sample sits tight around zero, so boxes that shift or
spread flag pipetting errors, sample spillage, injection-volume changes,
or drops in instrument sensitivity. In this run one sample stands out
from its batch as a candidate technical outlier.

``` r

plot_rla_boxplot(
  mexp,
  variable = "intensity",
  rla_type_batch = "within",
  qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL", "RQC", "TQC", "PBLK"),
  filter_data = FALSE,
  show_timestamp = FALSE,
  outlier_exclude = FALSE,
  x_gridlines = FALSE,
  batch_zebra_stripe = FALSE,
  linewidth = 0.1
)
```

![RLA boxplot per sample within
batches](tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow_files/figure-html/rla-plot-1.png)

Figure 5. Within-batch relative log abundance per sample; deviating
boxes flag pipetting, injection, or sensitivity issues.

## 10. PCA of all QC types

Principal component analysis condenses all features into a few axes and
gives a complementary overview of how the study and QC samples relate,
useful for spotting batch effects, technical outliers, and systematic
differences between sample types. Here it offers a second, independent
view of the candidate outlier flagged by the RLA plot.

``` r

plot_pca(
  mexp,
  variable = "feature_intensity",
  qc_types = c("SPL", "BQC", "TQC"),
  filter_data = FALSE,
  pca_dims = c(1, 2),
  labels_threshold_mad = 3,
  log_transform = TRUE,
  include_istd = FALSE,
  point_size = 2, point_alpha = 0.7, ellipse_alpha = 0.3, font_base_size = 8
)
```

![PCA of study and QC samples before outlier
removal](tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow_files/figure-html/pca-before-1.png)

Figure 6. PCA of study and QC samples before outlier removal.

## 11. Excluding technical outliers

With the outlier corroborated by both plots, we remove it from all
downstream processing using
[`exclude_analyses()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/exclude_analyses.md).
The function does not delete any data: it sets the sample’s
`valid_analysis` flag to `FALSE`, so it is simply skipped in later steps
and can be reinstated at any time. Replotting the PCA lets us confirm
the effect of the exclusion on the sample structure.

``` r

mexp <- exclude_analyses(
  mexp,
  analyses = "Longit_batch6_51",
  clear_existing = TRUE
)

plot_pca(
  mexp,
  variable = "intensity",
  qc_types = c("SPL", "BQC", "TQC"),
  filter_data = FALSE,
  pca_dims = c(1, 2),
  labels_threshold_mad = 3,
  log_transform = TRUE,
  include_istd = FALSE,
  shared_labeltext_hide = NA,
  point_size = 2, point_alpha = 0.7, ellipse_alpha = 0.3, font_base_size = 8
)
```

![PCA of study and QC samples after excluding the
outlier](tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow_files/figure-html/outlier-removal-1.png)

Figure 7. PCA after excluding the flagged technical outlier.

## 12. Response curves

A linear response is a prerequisite for comparing concentrations between
samples. Plasma lipid abundances span a wide dynamic range, and because
each class-specific ISTD is spiked at a single concentration, the
response may be linear near the ISTD level yet flatten for far more or
less abundant species. To verify this, we measured injection-volume
series at the start and end of the run as a dedicated QC. We first drop
the very lowest-abundance features, then plot the curves for a subset of
PC species; `include_feature_filter` accepts regular expressions, so any
class or chain-length pattern can be selected.

``` r

mexp <- filter_features_qc(
  mexp,
  include_qualifier = FALSE,
  include_istd = TRUE,
  min.intensity.median.spl = 200
)
plot_responsecurves(
  mexp,
  variable = "intensity",
  filter_data = TRUE,
  include_feature_filter = "^PC 3[0-5]",
  output_pdf = FALSE,
  cols_page = 5, rows_page = 4
)
```

![Response curves for selected PC
species](tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow_files/figure-html/responsecurves-1.png)

Figure 8. Response curves for selected PC species over the
injection-volume series.

## 13. Isotope interference correction

Some peaks of interest are co-integrated with the isotopic peaks of
other lipid species, for example the M+2 isotope of a species two mass
units lighter falling in the same transition.
[`correct_custom_interferences()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/correct_custom_interferences.md)
subtracts these declared contributions from the raw feature intensities,
reading which feature interferes with which, and by how much, from the
metadata; the original values are preserved in
`feature_intensity_before`. The interference factors here were derived
with LICAR (<https://github.com/SLINGhub/LICAR>). Inspect the “Features
(Analytes)” sheet of the metadata file to see which species are
affected.

``` r

mexp <- correct_custom_interferences(mexp)
plot_interference_correction(
  mexp,
  qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL", "TQC", "LTR")
)
```

![QC plot of species before and after interference
correction](tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow_files/figure-html/isotope-correction-1.png)

Figure 9. Selected species before and after isotope-interference
correction.

## 14. Normalization and quantification based on ISTDs

Quantification proceeds in two steps.
[`normalize_by_istd()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/normalize_by_istd.md)
divides each lipid’s peak area by the area of its assigned
class-specific internal standard *within the same injection*, writing
the ratio to `feature_norm_intensity`; this cancels most of the
injection-to-injection and matrix variation shared by an analyte and its
ISTD.
[`quantify_by_istd()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/quantify_by_istd.md)
then converts those ratios into absolute concentrations from three
quantities held in the metadata (the ISTD concentration in the spike
solution, the spiked volume, and the sample amount) and stores the
result in `feature_conc`. Because both new variables sit beside the raw
areas, the RLA and PCA plots above can be rerun on the normalised data
with `variable = "norm_intensity"` or `variable = "conc"`.

``` r

mexp <- normalize_by_istd(mexp)
```

    ✔ 460 features normalized with 17 ISTDs in 498 analyses.

``` r

mexp <- quantify_by_istd(mexp)
```

    ✔ 460 feature concentrations calculated based on 42 ISTDs and sample amounts of 498 analyses.

    ✔ Concentrations are given in μmol/L.

## 15. Effects of class-wide ISTD normalization

Class-specific ISTDs are common practice in lipidomics, but they are
rarely authentic standards for every species they normalise. A
non-authentic ISTD may elute at a different time, experience different
matrix effects, and fragment differently, so its response can diverge
from that of the analyte. Normalising against such an ISTD can then
*add* variability rather than remove it. Because a good ISTD should
reduce the coefficient of variation (CV), comparing the CV of QC and
study samples before and after normalisation is a direct way to catch a
misbehaving standard: a class whose CV rises after normalisation is a
warning sign worth investigating before trusting its concentrations.

``` r

mexp <- filter_features_qc(
  mexp,
  include_qualifier = FALSE,
  include_istd = TRUE,
  min.intensity.median.spl = 1000
)
plot_normalization_qc(
  mexp,
  before_norm_var = "intensity",
  after_norm_var = "norm_intensity",
  plot_type = "diff",
  qc_types = c("TQC", "BQC", "SPL"),
  facet_by_class = TRUE,
  point_size = 2,
  y_lim = c(-5, 15)
)
```

![Normalization QC plot of CV change per feature by
class](tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow_files/figure-html/norm-effects-1.png)

Figure 10. Change in CV per feature after ISTD normalisation, faceted by
lipid class.

## 16. Drift correction

Even after ISTD normalisation, concentrations can drift gradually within
a batch as the instrument response changes. We correct this with a
Gaussian-kernel smoother fitted through the study samples in each batch
(`batch_wise = TRUE`), which suits large, well-randomised sample sets
like this longitudinal study; `kernel_size` sets the width of the
smoothing window. The corrected values replace `conc`, the
pre-correction values are kept in `conc_before`, and the fitted trend in
`conc_before_fit`. The summary the function prints is not a formal
diagnostic of the fit but a quick check (reported as a change in median
CV) that the correction improved precision without introducing
artefacts. A scale correction along the fit is available via
`scale_smooth = TRUE`.

``` r

mexp <- correct_drift_gaussiankernel(
  mexp,
  variable = "conc",
  ref_qc_types = "SPL",
  ignore_istd = TRUE,
  batch_wise = TRUE,
  replace_previous = TRUE,
  recalc_trend_after = TRUE,
  kernel_size = 10,
  outlier_filter = FALSE,
  outlier_ksd = 5,
  location_smooth = TRUE,
  scale_smooth = FALSE,
  show_progress = FALSE
)
```

    ! 4 feature(s) contain one or more zero or negative `conc` values. Verify your data or use `log_transform_internal = FALSE`.

    ! 1 features showed no variation in the study sample's original values across analyses. 

    ! 1 features have invalid values after smoothing. NA will be be returned for all values of these faetures. Set `use_original_if_fail = FALSE to return orginal values..

    ! Smoothing failed for 1 feature(s) in all batches. Please check data, metadata, and fit parameters.

    ! Smoothing failed for 1 feature(s) in at least one batch: PG 36:2. Please check data, metadata and fit parameters.

    ✔ Drift correction was applied to 459 of 460 features (batch-wise).

    ℹ The median per-feature CV change of all features in study samples was -1.00% (range: -12.53% to 2.59%; a positive value means the CV increased). The median CV across all features across batches decreased from 39.00% to 37.71%.

To see the effect, we plot one example species (PC 40:8) before and
after correction. Since we reuse the same plot several times, we wrap it
in a small function with the recurring parameters preset; `variable`
selects which stage to show (`conc_before` or `conc`) and `feature`
which species.

``` r

my_trend_plot <- function(variable, feature) {
  plot_runscatter(
    mexp,
    variable = variable,
    qc_types = c("BQC", "TQC", "SPL"),
    include_feature_filter = feature,
    exclude_feature_filter = "ISTD",
    cap_outliers = TRUE,
    log_scale = FALSE,
    show_trend = TRUE,
    output_pdf = FALSE,
    cols_page = 1, rows_page = 1
  )
}
```

``` r

my_trend_plot("conc_before", "PC 40:8")
```

correction](tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow_files/figure-html/plot-trend-after-1.png)

Figure 12. PC 40:8 concentrations after within-batch drift correction.

## 17. Batch-effect correction

Drift correction flattens the trend inside each batch but leaves the
batches at different levels, since each is fitted independently.
[`correct_batch_centering()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/correct_batch_centering.md)
aligns them by shifting every batch to a common median, computed from
the study samples (`ref_qc_types = "SPL"`); `correct_scale = TRUE`
additionally equalises the between-batch spread. As with drift
correction, the aligned values replace `conc` and the previous ones are
retained in `conc_before`. We replot the example species to confirm the
batches now line up.

``` r

mexp <- correct_batch_centering(
  mexp,
  variable = "conc",
  ref_qc_types = "SPL",
  replace_previous = TRUE,
  correct_location = TRUE,
  correct_scale = TRUE,
  log_transform_internal = TRUE
)

my_trend_plot("conc", "PC 40:8")
```

centering](tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow_files/figure-html/batch-effect-corr-1.png)

batch trends are aligned.

## 18. Saving runscatter plots of all features as PDF

For a full record it helps to save runscatter plots for every species,
or a chosen subset, to a multi-page PDF in the `output` subfolder.
Blanks are usually worth excluding, as they can show erratic
concentrations when feature and ISTD signals sit close together or below
the limit of detection. The `include_feature_filter` and
`exclude_feature_filter` arguments select analytes and both accept
regular expressions, which a language model can help you construct for
more intricate patterns.

``` r

plot_runscatter(
  mexp,
  variable = "conc",
  qc_types = c("BQC", "TQC", "SPL"),
  include_feature_filter = NA,
  exclude_feature_filter = "ISTD",
  cap_outliers = TRUE,
  log_scale = FALSE,
  show_trend = TRUE,
  output_pdf = TRUE,
  path = "./output/runscatter_after-drift-batch-correction.pdf",
  page_width = 297, page_height = 210,
  cols_page = 2, rows_page = 2,
  show_progress = TRUE
)
```

`page_width` and `page_height` set the page size; without them an A4
page is used, oriented by `page_orientation`.

The single figures made earlier in this workflow are saved with
[`save_plot()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/save_plot.md),
which writes any plot at a defined size and resolution and can produce
several formats in one call:

``` r

plot_pca(mexp, variable = "conc", qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL")) |>
  save_plot(path = "./output/pca", format = c("pdf", "png"),
            width = 180, height = 120)
```

The plot is returned visibly, so it still appears in the notebook while

## 19. QC-based feature filtering

The final curation step removes features that fail defined QC criteria.
[`filter_features_qc()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/filter_features_qc.md)
combines several: the quality of the response curves (minimum r², slope,
and maximum y-intercept), the signal-to-blank ratio against process
blanks, the absolute signal level as a proxy for the limit of detection,
and the precision in the batch QCs (`max.cv.conc.bqc`). The criteria are
applied *hierarchically* (a feature counts as failing CV only once it
has passed the S/B and signal filters) and `features.to.keep` retains
named species regardless. The filter can be run repeatedly, overwriting
or, with `clear_existing = FALSE`, amending the previous set.

``` r

mexp <- filter_features_qc(
  mexp,
  clear_existing = TRUE,
  use_batch_medians = TRUE,
  include_qualifier = FALSE,
  include_istd = FALSE,
  response.curves.selection = c(1, 2),
  response.curves.summary = "mean",
  min.rsquare.response = 0.8,
  min.slope.response = 0.75,
  max.yintercept.response = 0.5,
  min.signalblank.median.spl.pblk = 10,
  min.intensity.median.spl = 100,
  max.cv.conc.bqc = 25,
  features.to.keep = c(
    "CE 20:4", "CE 22:5", "CE 22:6", "CE 16:0", "CE 18:0"
  )
)
```

    ! %CV not computed for 4440 feature×QC-type×variable combinations with fewer than 3 replicates (LTR: 4440).

    ✔ QC metrics calculated for 502 features across 7 sample types, including normalized-intensity, concentration, and response-curve statistics.

    ! The QC parameter min.intensity.median.spl contains NAs for the following features: LPC O-22:1, PC 34:5, PC 35:1, SM 35:1|PC P_32:1 M+1, and SM 35:1|PC P-32:1 M+1. These features failed QC.

    ! The QC parameter min.signalblank.median.spl.pblk contains NAs for the following features: LPC O-22:1, PC 34:5, PC 35:1, PG 36:2, SM 35:1|PC P_32:1 M+1, and SM 35:1|PC .... These features failed QC.

    ! The QC parameter max.cv.conc.bqc contains NAs for the following features: Cer d18:1/12:0 (ISTD) [M-H20>264], Cer d18:1/25:0 (ISTD) [M-H20>264], Hex2Cer.... These features failed QC.

    ! The following features were forced to be retained despite not meeting filtering criteria: CE 16:0, CE 20:4, CE 22:5, and CE 22:6

    ✔ New feature QC filters were defined: 324 of 423 quantifier features meet QC criteria (not including the 25 quantifier ISTD features).

## 20. Summary of the QC filtering

The plot below summarises the filtering per lipid class. Green segments
count the species that passed every criterion; the remaining segments
count those that failed each one. Because the criteria are hierarchical,
a species is attributed to the *first* filter it fails (for example
`CV`), having already cleared the lower ones (`S/B`, `LOD`), so the
counts partition the features rather than double-counting them.

``` r

plot_qc_summary_byclass(mexp)
```

class](tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow_files/figure-html/qc-summary-byclass-1.png)

Figure 14. Feature QC filtering outcome per lipid class; green marks
species passing all criteria.

The next plot gives the same picture across all features, with the total
retained, and adds a Venn diagram showing how many features each
individual criterion excluded, and where those exclusions overlap.

``` r

plot_qc_summary_overall(mexp)
```

diagram](tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow_files/figure-html/qc-summary-overall-1.png)

exclusion criteria.

## 21. Lipidome profile

As a final check, we plot the concentration profile of the filtered
dataset. Comparing these values (the most abundant species, the summed
concentration per class, or the ratios between classes) against in-house
reference ranges or the literature is the quickest way to confirm that
quantification landed in a plausible range and that no gross errors
slipped through.

``` r

plot_abundanceprofile(
  mexp,
  variable = "conc",
  qc_types = "SPL",
  filter_data = TRUE,
  log_scale = TRUE,
  x_label = NA,
  feature_map = "lipidomics"
)
```

lipidome](tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow_files/figure-html/lipidprofile-1.png)

## 22. Saving a report with data, metadata and processing details

The full post-processing can be written to a formatted Excel workbook,
with separate sheets for the raw and processed datasets, the associated
metadata, the per-feature QC metrics, and a record of the processing
steps applied: a self-contained account of how the numbers were
produced.

``` r

save_report_xlsx(mexp, path = tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx"))
```

    ✔ The data processing report of experiment 'sPerfect' has been saved to /tmp/RtmpPpCHte/file346527a6109e.xlsx.

For downstream statistics it is often easier to export a single flat,
wide CSV of a chosen data subset. This is the format used to share the
data for the statistical analysis in the next part of the workshop.

``` r

save_dataset_csv(
  mexp,
  path = tempfile(fileext = ".csv"),
  variable = "conc",
  qc_types = "SPL",
  include_qualifier = FALSE,
  filter_data = TRUE
)
```

## 23. Sharing the MRMhubExperiment dataset

Finally, the whole `mexp` object can be serialized to an `RDS` file and
shared. `RDS` files open in any R session (even without the mrmhub
package installed) and the saved `MRMhubExperiment` can be reloaded for
further processing, replotting, or inspection with mrmhub.

``` r

path <- tempfile(fileext = ".rds")
saveRDS(mexp, file = path, compress = TRUE)
my_saved_exp <- readRDS(file = path)
print(my_saved_exp)
```
