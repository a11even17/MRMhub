# Custom QC report

Recipe Prerequisites: [Basic
workflow](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/tutorial-02-basic-workflow.md)

A QC report gathers the quality indicators for a processed experiment
into a single self-contained HTML file that can be shared, emailed or
archived. This recipe assembles one from a fully processed
`MRMhubExperiment`: a summary of sample and feature counts, the QC CV
distribution, run-order scatter plots for the least reproducible
features, a feature pass/fail table, calibration metrics where a
calibration was run, and any excluded analyses. Each piece can be
dropped into the parameterized Quarto template given at the end, so the
same report regenerates for any study.

The report reads an experiment that has already been through import,
metadata annotation, normalization and QC-metric calculation:

``` r

library(mrmhub)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gt)

mexp <- readRDS("results/mexp_processed.rds")
```

## Summary table

A compact overview: counts of analyses, samples, blanks and features,
the number of batches, and whether drift and batch correction were
applied.

``` r

summary_tbl <- tibble::tibble(
  Metric = c("Total analyses", "Study samples (SPL)", "QC samples",
             "Blanks", "Features (total)", "Features (measured)",
             "Batches", "Drift corrected?", "Batch corrected?"),
  Value = c(
    get_analysis_count(mexp),
    mexp@annot_analyses |> filter(qc_type == "SPL") |> nrow(),
    mexp@annot_analyses |> filter(grepl("QC", qc_type)) |> nrow(),
    mexp@annot_analyses |> filter(grepl("BLK", qc_type)) |> nrow(),
    nrow(mexp@annot_features),
    get_feature_count(mexp),
    length(unique(mexp@annot_analyses$batch_id)),
    ifelse(any(mexp@var_drift_corrected), "Yes", "No"),
    ifelse(any(mexp@var_batch_corrected), "Yes", "No")
  )
)

summary_tbl |> gt::gt() |> gt::tab_header(title = "Study Summary")
```

## CV distribution

The coefficient of variation across the batch QC (BQC) samples is the
primary precision metric; the histogram shows how many features fall
within a chosen CV limit. The 30 % line here is illustrative. See
[Sample types and QC
roles](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/manual-06-sample-types.md)
for which QC types drive this metric.

``` r

cv_data <- mexp@metrics_qc |>
  select(feature_id, cv = norm_intensity_cv_bqc) |>
  filter(!is.na(cv))

ggplot(cv_data, aes(x = cv)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "#5B8FA8", colour = "white") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 30, linetype = "dashed", colour = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "QC CV Distribution",
    subtitle = paste0(sum(cv_data$cv <= 30), "/", nrow(cv_data),
                      " features with CV \u2264 30%"),
    x = "CV (%)", y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Run-order scatter for the worst features

Plotting the least reproducible features against acquisition order shows
whether the high CV comes from drift, a step change between batches, or
scattered outliers.

``` r

top_cv_features <- cv_data |>
  arrange(desc(cv)) |>
  head(4) |>
  pull(feature_id)

plots <- lapply(top_cv_features, function(feat) {
  plot_runscatter(mexp,
                  variable = "norm_intensity",
                  include_feature_filter = feat,
                  qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL")) +
    ggtitle(feat)
})

if (requireNamespace("patchwork", quietly = TRUE)) {
  patchwork::wrap_plots(plots, ncol = 2)
}
```

## Feature pass/fail table

A per-feature verdict from the BQC CV and D-ratio. The thresholds below
(CV ≤ 30 %, D-ratio ≤ 0.5) are illustrative defaults; MRMhub’s own
feature filtering is applied with
[`filter_features_qc()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/filter_features_qc.md).

``` r

qc_table <- mexp@metrics_qc |>
  select(feature_id, norm_intensity_cv_bqc, normint_dratio_sd_bqc) |>
  mutate(
    cv_pass = norm_intensity_cv_bqc <= 30,
    dratio_pass = normint_dratio_sd_bqc <= 0.5,
    status = case_when(
      cv_pass & dratio_pass ~ "PASS",
      !cv_pass & !dratio_pass ~ "FAIL (CV + D-ratio)",
      !cv_pass ~ "FAIL (CV)",
      !dratio_pass ~ "FAIL (D-ratio)"
    )
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(norm_intensity_cv_bqc))

qc_table |>
  gt::gt() |>
  gt::fmt_number(
    columns = c(norm_intensity_cv_bqc, normint_dratio_sd_bqc),
    decimals = 1) |>
  gt::data_color(
    columns = status,
    fn = function(x) ifelse(x == "PASS", "#d4e8d4", "#f8d4d4")
  ) |>
  gt::tab_header(title = "Feature QC Summary")
```

## Calibration summary

Where the experiment was quantified against external calibration curves,
the fit metrics summarise each curve: model, weighting, R² and the
calibrated range.

``` r

if (nrow(mexp@metrics_calibration) > 0) {
  cal_summary <- get_calibration_metrics(mexp) |>
    select(
      feature_id, r2, fit_model, fit_weighting,
      lowest_cal, highest_cal) |>
    arrange(r2)

  cal_summary |>
    gt::gt() |>
    gt::fmt_number(columns = c(r2, lowest_cal, highest_cal), decimals = 4) |>
    gt::tab_header(title = "Calibration Curve Metrics")
}
```

## Excluded analyses

Any analyses removed from processing and reporting, kept in the report
for the audit trail.

``` r

if (!all(is.na(mexp@analyses_excluded))) {
  tibble::tibble(
    analysis_id = mexp@analyses_excluded,
    reason = "Excluded during processing"
  ) |> gt::gt() |> gt::tab_header(title = "Excluded Analyses")
}
```

## Parameterized Quarto template

**Full template (click to expand)**

Save as `qc-report-template.qmd`:

    ---
    title: "QC Report"
    date: today
    format:
      html:
        self-contained: true
        toc: true
    params:
      rds_path: "results/mexp_processed.rds"
    ---

Then include each section above as a code chunk in the template.

Render the template:

``` r

quarto::quarto_render(
  "qc-report-template.qmd",
  execute_params = list(rds_path = "results/mexp_processed.rds"))
```

## Tips

- **Self-contained HTML**: a single file that can be emailed or
  archived.
- **Parameterize** the RDS path so the same template works for any
  study.
- **Date stamp** (`date: today`) for an audit trail.
- **Session info** at the end for reproducibility.
- **Export the figures too**:
  `save_plot(p, "figures/cv", format = c("pdf", "png"), width = 180, height = 120)`
  writes a print-ready vector file and a web-ready raster one in a
  single call. See [Saving
  plots](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/manual-08-visualization.html#saving-plots).
