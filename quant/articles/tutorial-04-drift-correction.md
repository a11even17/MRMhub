# Drift and batch correction

Tutorial Prerequisites: [Full
workflow](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow.md)

Signal intensities in a mass-spectrometry run drift with injection order
and shift between analytical batches. MRMhub corrects run-order drift by
smoothing a trend through reference samples, and batch effects by median
centering. Both operate on a data variable of an `MRMhubExperiment` (raw
intensities, normalized intensities, or concentrations) and are fitted
on QC or study samples only, never mixed. After this tutorial you can
select an appropriate correction method for a given QC design and apply
drift and batch correction in the correct order.

## 1. Import data

We import pre-calculated raw concentration values from a CSV file.
Batch-wise correction requires a `batch_id` column; see
[`import_data_csv_wide()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/import_data_csv_wide.md)
for the expected format.

``` r

library(mrmhub)

mexp <- MRMhubExperiment()
mexp <- import_data_csv_wide(
  mexp,
  path = "smooth-testdata.csv",
  variable_name = "conc",
  import_metadata = TRUE
)
```

## 2. QC-based drift correction

Apply a QC-based drift correction with a cubic spline fitted through the
batch QC samples (`BQC`). The reported change in median CV summarises
whether the correction improved analytical precision.

``` r

mexp_drift <- correct_drift_cubicspline(
  mexp,
  variable = "conc",
  batch_wise = FALSE,
  ref_qc_types = "BQC",
  recalc_trend_after = TRUE
)
```

    ✔ Drift correction was applied to 3 of 3 features (across all batches).

    ℹ The median per-feature CV change of all features in study samples was -4.69% (range: -8.21% to 1.17%; a positive value means the CV increased). The median CV across all features decreased from 30.56% to 28.52%.

``` r

plot_runscatter(
  mexp_drift,
  variable = "conc_before",
  qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL"),
  rows_page = 1, cols_page = 3, show_trend = TRUE
)
```

Figure 1. Concentrations before QC-based drift correction; the fitted
trend (green) follows the BQC points (red).

``` r

plot_runscatter(
  mexp_drift,
  variable = "conc",
  qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL"),
  rows_page = 1, cols_page = 3, show_trend = TRUE
)
```

![RunScatter of concentrations after QC-based drift
correction](tutorial-04-drift-correction_files/figure-html/drift-cubicspline-after-1.png)

Figure 2. Concentrations after QC-based drift correction; the BQC trend
is flat.

The fitted trend (green) tracks the `BQC` points (red) before correction
and is flat afterwards. Flattening the `BQC` trend does not, however,
necessarily straighten the study-sample (`SPL`) trend, since pooled QCs
can differ from the study samples in handling and matrix.

## 3. Sample-based drift correction

When QC samples do not represent the study-sample trend, fit the drift
on the study samples instead. Gaussian kernel smoothing is suited to
this because study samples are numerous but individually noisy;
`kernel_size` sets the smoothing window. The study-sample trend is then
well corrected, though for this dataset the difference from the QC-based
result above is modest.

``` r

mexp_drift <- correct_drift_gaussiankernel(
  mexp,
  variable = "conc",
  batch_wise = FALSE,
  ref_qc_types = "SPL",
  kernel_size = 10,
  recalc_trend_after = TRUE
)
```

``` r

plot_runscatter(
  mexp_drift,
  variable = "conc",
  qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL"),
  rows_page = 1, cols_page = 3, show_trend = TRUE
)
```

correction](tutorial-04-drift-correction_files/figure-html/drift-gaussian-after-1.png)

correction; the study-sample trend is flat.

## 4. Within-batch drift correction

The corrections above span all batches. When batch effects interrupt the
drift, fit the trend within each batch by setting `batch_wise = TRUE`.

``` r

mexp_drift <- correct_drift_gaussiankernel(
  mexp,
  variable = "conc",
  batch_wise = TRUE,
  ref_qc_types = "SPL",
  kernel_size = 10,
  recalc_trend_after = TRUE
)
```

``` r

plot_runscatter(
  mexp_drift,
  variable = "conc",
  qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL"),
  rows_page = 1, cols_page = 3, show_trend = TRUE
)
```

![RunScatter after within-batch drift correction, residual between-batch
differences](tutorial-04-drift-correction_files/figure-html/drift-batchwise-after-1.png)

Figure 4. Concentrations after within-batch drift correction; residual
trend differences remain between batches.

Clear trend differences remain between batches because each batch is
fitted independently, so differing sample sizes and batch effects are
not reconciled. A batch correction is therefore usually applied after
batch-wise drift correction. Apply a subsequent batch correction by
median centering to align the batches.

``` r

mexp_drift <- correct_batch_centering(
  mexp_drift,
  variable = "conc",
  ref_qc_types = "SPL",
  correct_scale = TRUE
)

plot_runscatter(
  mexp_drift,
  variable = "conc",
  qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL"),
  rows_page = 1, cols_page = 3, show_trend = TRUE
)
```

centering](tutorial-04-drift-correction_files/figure-html/drift-then-batch-1.png)

Figure 5. Concentrations after within-batch drift correction followed by
median-centering batch correction; batches are aligned.

## 5. Batch-effect correction

Batch effects (systematic differences between analytical batches) are
corrected on their own with
[`correct_batch_centering()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/correct_batch_centering.md).
The following uses a seven-batch dataset to show the effect clearly.
Each batch is centered on a reference QC type, here the study samples
(`ref_qc_types = "SPL"`).

``` r

mexp_batch <- MRMhubExperiment()
mexp_batch <- import_data_csv_wide(
  mexp_batch,
  path = "simdata-u1000-sd100_7batches.csv",
  variable_name = "conc",
  import_metadata = TRUE
)
```

``` r

mexp_batch <- correct_batch_centering(
  mexp_batch,
  variable = "conc",
  ref_qc_types = "SPL",
  correct_scale = FALSE
)
```

    ! Adding batch correction to `conc` data.

    ✔ Batch median-centering of 7 batches was applied to raw concentrations of all 1 features.

    ℹ The median per-feature CV change of all features in study samples was -30.49% (range: -30.50% to -30.50%; a positive value means the CV increased).  The median CV across all features decreased from 44.05% to 13.56%.

``` r

plot_runscatter(
  mexp_batch,
  variable = "conc_before",
  rows_page = 1, cols_page = 1
)
```

![RunScatter before batch correction, batches

Figure 6. Concentrations before batch correction; batch medians are
offset from one another.

``` r

plot_runscatter(
  mexp_batch,
  variable = "conc",
  rows_page = 1, cols_page = 1
)
```

![RunScatter after median-centering batch correction, batches
aligned](tutorial-04-drift-correction_files/figure-html/batch-after-1.png)

Figure 7. Concentrations after median-centering batch correction; batch
medians are aligned.

The batches are aligned in location, but their spread still differs.
Setting `correct_scale = TRUE` also equalises the variance between
batches.

``` r

mexp_batch <- correct_batch_centering(
  mexp_batch,
  variable = "conc",
  ref_qc_types = "SPL",
  correct_scale = TRUE
)

plot_runscatter(
  mexp_batch,
  variable = "conc",
  rows_page = 1, cols_page = 1
)
```

scaling](tutorial-04-drift-correction_files/figure-html/batch-scale-1.png)

Figure 8. Concentrations after batch correction with variance scaling;
both location and spread are consistent across batches.

### Alternative batch-correction methods (experimental)

Besides median centering, two model-based methods are available. Both
are experimental and require an optional package.

**ComBat** (Johnson et al. 2007) applies an empirical-Bayes location and
scale adjustment, shrinking the batch estimates across features
(requires the `sva` package). Unlike centering and SERRF, it estimates
batch effects from all samples; pass `covariates` to protect biology on
unbalanced designs.

``` r

mexp_batch <- correct_batch_combat(
  mexp_batch,
  variable = "conc",
  ref_qc_types = "SPL"
)
```

**SERRF** (Fan et al. 2019) trains a per-feature random forest on the
reference QCs and removes the predicted systematic error, capturing
non-linear batch and drift effects jointly (requires the `ranger`
package). It suits larger panels with dense QC coverage; the
implementation adapts the `malbacR` reference (Leach et al. 2023).

``` r

mexp_batch <- correct_batch_serrf(
  mexp_batch,
  variable = "conc",
  ref_qc_types = "SPL"
)
```

## 6. Choosing a drift-correction method

MRMhub provides four drift-correction methods. Loess and cubic spline
are typically fitted on QC samples, Gaussian kernel on study samples; a
fourth, GAM smoothing via
[`correct_drift_gam()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/correct_drift_gam.md),
is also available. See [Drift and batch correction
(reference)](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/manual-07-corrections.md)
for the full parameter description of all four.

| Method | Function | Reference | Typical use |
|----|----|----|----|
| Loess | [`correct_drift_loess()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/correct_drift_loess.md) | QC | Frequent QC injections; robust to single outlier QCs |
| Cubic spline | [`correct_drift_cubicspline()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/correct_drift_cubicspline.md) | QC | Frequent QC injections; flexible, sensitive to outlier QCs |
| Gaussian kernel | [`correct_drift_gaussiankernel()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/correct_drift_gaussiankernel.md) | Study | Sparse QCs; large, well-randomised sample sets only |

Loess uses locally weighted regression and is less sensitive to
individual outlier QCs than a cubic spline; its `span` controls
smoothness.

``` r

mexp_drift_loess <- correct_drift_loess(
  mexp,
  variable = "conc",
  batch_wise = TRUE,
  ref_qc_types = "BQC",
  recalc_trend_after = TRUE
)
```

## 7. Export corrected data

Continue processing the corrected object with MRMhub functions, or
export the corrected variable to CSV.

``` r

save_dataset_csv(
  mexp_drift,
  path = "drift-batch-corrected-conc-data.csv",
  variable = "conc",
  filter_data = FALSE
)
```

    ✔ Concentration values for 498 analyses and 3 features have been exported to 'drift-batch-corrected-conc-data.csv'.
