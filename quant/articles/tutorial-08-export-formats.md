# Exporting to standard and community formats

Tutorial Prerequisites: [Full
workflow](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/tutorial-03-lipidomics-workflow.md)

Sharing results or running downstream statistics usually means handing
the data to another tool. MRMhub offers two export routes: **mzTab-M**,
the HUPO-PSI community standard that repositories expect, and a
Bioconductor **SummarizedExperiment** for downstream analysis with
`limma` (differential abundance) or `lipidr` (lipid-specific analysis).

Both examples start from a processed object. Here we build one from the
bundled `lipidomics_dataset`; in practice this would be your own.

``` r

library(mrmhub)

mexp <- lipidomics_dataset |>
  normalize_by_istd() |>
  quantify_by_istd()
```

## 1. mzTab-M

[mzTab-M](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzTab-M) is the HUPO-PSI community
standard for reporting metabolomics and lipidomics quantification. It is
a plain, tab-delimited text format that opens in Excel yet is fully
machine-readable, and is what repositories such as
[MetaboLights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/) expect on
submission.

[`save_dataset_mztab()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/save_dataset_mztab.md)
writes a processed experiment to an mzTab-M 2.0.0-M file:

``` r

out_dir <- tempdir()

save_dataset_mztab(mexp, file.path(out_dir, "experiment.mzTab"))
```

By default the final concentrations (`feature_conc`) are written as the
per-sample abundances, with the concentration unit declared in the
header. If the experiment has not been quantified, the exporter falls
back to the raw `feature_intensity` and declares an “Arbitrary
quantification unit”. Choose a different abundance variable with
`variable`:

``` r

save_dataset_mztab(
  mexp, file.path(out_dir, "raw_areas.mzTab"),
  variable = "area")
```

The full dataset is exported, every analysis (including QC, blank and
calibration samples) and every feature:

| mzTab-M section | mrmhub source |
|----|----|
| `MTD` metadata | title, units, one `ms_run`/`assay` per analysis, one `study_variable` per `qc_type` |
| `SMF` (feature) | one row per `feature_id` (quantifiers, qualifiers **and** ISTDs); `abundance_assay[n]` = chosen variable; ISTDs flagged via `opt_global_is_internal_standard` |
| `SML` (summary) | one row per analyte, grouping its features; the quantifier drives the summary abundance and per-group mean / %CV |
| `SME` (evidence) | a minimal identification stub per feature |

Enrich the metadata header with optional arguments:

``` r

save_dataset_mztab(
  mexp, file.path(out_dir, "experiment.mzTab"),
  instrument = "Agilent 6495C QqQ",
  contact = "Jane Doe",
  publication = "doi:10.1234/example")
```

mzTab-M is a quantification report, not a full processing record:
internal-standard relationships, QC and calibration metrics, and
drift/batch state are not part of the model and are not reproduced on
round-trip. Keep the `MRMhubExperiment` (or the Excel report from
[`save_report_xlsx()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/save_report_xlsx.md))
as the definitive record.

### Validating the file

The output targets mzTab-M **2.0.0-M**. To confirm conformance, upload
the file to the HUPO-PSI / LIFS web validator at
<https://apps.lifs-tools.org/mztabvalidator/>, or parse it back with the
reference R package [`rmzTabM`](https://lifs-tools.github.io/rmzTabM/):

``` r

m <- rmzTabM::readMzTab(file.path(out_dir, "experiment.mzTab"))
rmzTabM::extractSmallMoleculeFeatures(m)
```

MRMhub has **no runtime dependency** on `rmzTabM`; the writer is
self-contained.

### Importing mzTab-M

[`import_data_mztab()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/import_data_mztab.md)
ingests mzTab-M produced by other tools (for example [Lipid Data
Analyzer](http://genome.tugraz.at/lda2/), MS-DIAL or MZmine) into an
`MRMhubExperiment`:

``` r

mexp_in <- MRMhubExperiment(title = "Imported lipidomics")
mexp_in <- import_data_mztab(mexp_in, "LDA_export.mzTab")
```

Each Small Molecule Feature (`SMF`) becomes a feature and each assay an
analysis. The per-assay abundances are imported as `feature_intensity`,
and feature identities (name, formula, neutral mass, m/z, retention
time) come from the `SMF`/`SML` sections. Where one analyte is reported
as several features (e.g. different adducts), the adduct is appended to
keep `feature_id` unique (`Cer d18:1/16:0 | [M-H]-`).

Import is partial by nature: mzTab-M carries a single abundance per
feature, so internal-standard relationships, QC-type assignments, and
calibration metadata are absent and must be supplied with
[`add_metadata()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/add_metadata.md).
`study_variable` groups are imported best-effort as `batch_id`.

## 2. SummarizedExperiment

[SummarizedExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SummarizedExperiment/)
is the Bioconductor container many statistical and lipidomics tools
consume.
[`save_dataset_summarizedexperiment()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/save_dataset_summarizedexperiment.md)
produces one, with features as **rows** and analyses as **columns**:

``` r

library(SummarizedExperiment)

se <- save_dataset_summarizedexperiment(mexp)
se
#> class: SummarizedExperiment
#> dim: 29 499
#> metadata(11): title analysis_type ... var_batch_corrected mrmhub_version
#> assays(9): rt area ... pmol_total conc
#> rownames(29): CE 18:1 CE 18:1 d7 (ISTD) ... TG 48:2 [-18:1] TG 48:2 [SIM]
#> rowData names(18): feature_id feature_class ... remarks feature_label
#> colnames(499): Longit_BLANK-01 (Eluent A) ... Longit_BLANK-07 (Eluent A)
#> colData names(13): analysis_order analysis_id ... annot_order_num remarks
```

Install the package once with
`BiocManager::install("SummarizedExperiment")`. Pass a `path` to also
write the object to disk as an `.rds`; without one it is only returned:

``` r

save_dataset_summarizedexperiment(mexp, "experiment.rds")
```

The mapping from experiment slots is:

| Component | mrmhub source |
|----|----|
| [`assays()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/SummarizedExperiment/man/SummarizedExperiment-class.html) | one matrix per feature variable, named without the `feature_` prefix |
| [`rowData()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/SummarizedExperiment/man/SummarizedExperiment-class.html) | `annot_features`: one row per `feature_id` |
| [`colData()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/SummarizedExperiment/man/SummarizedExperiment-class.html) | `annot_analyses`: one row per `analysis_id` |
| `metadata()` | title, analysis type, processing status, `is_*` flags, concentration unit, MRMhub version |

The parallel feature variables become **parallel assays**, so raw,
normalized and quantified values live side-by-side in one object:

``` r

assayNames(se)
#> [1] "rt"     "area"   "height" "fwhm"   "width"  "intensity"
#> [7] "norm_intensity" "pmol_total" "conc"

assay(se, "conc")[1:3, 1:2]
```

Export a subset of variables with `variable`, or QC-filtered data by
filtering first and passing `filter_data = TRUE`:

``` r

se_conc <- save_dataset_summarizedexperiment(mexp, variable = "conc")

mexp_filt <- mexp |>
  calc_qc_metrics() |>
  filter_features_qc(
    include_qualifier = FALSE,
    include_istd = FALSE,
    max.cv.conc.bqc = 25)

se_filt <- save_dataset_summarizedexperiment(mexp_filt, filter_data = TRUE)
```

### Subsetting to study samples

Everything is exported and flagged rather than dropped, since downstream
tools need it (`lipidr`, for example, requires the internal-standard
annotation). But nothing downstream reads `qc_type`, so subset to study
samples before a PCA, normalization, or differential test; otherwise
blanks and QCs are folded in with the samples:

``` r

se_spl <- se[!rowData(se)$is_istd, se$qc_type == "SPL"]
dim(se_spl)
#> [1]  20 374
```

QC metrics are deliberately *not* written to
[`rowData()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/SummarizedExperiment/man/SummarizedExperiment-class.html):
nothing downstream reads them, and QC filtering belongs in MRMhub where
it is tested. Use `filter_data = TRUE` as above, or
[`save_feature_qc_metrics()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/save_feature_qc_metrics.md)
for the metrics.

### Differential abundance with limma

[limma](https://bioconductor.org/packages/limma/) works directly on
continuous data such as concentrations.
[`voom()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/limma/man/voom.html) is **not** used: it
models count data and is invalid here.

The bundled `lipidomics_dataset` carries no phenotype: every study
sample is plasma from the same longitudinal series. The grouping below
is **simulated to demonstrate the interface only**; the p-values are
meaningless by construction. With your own data the group would come
from your sample metadata and already be in
[`colData()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/SummarizedExperiment/man/SummarizedExperiment-class.html).

``` r

library(limma)

set.seed(1)
se_spl$group <- factor(
  sample(c("ctrl", "trt"), ncol(se_spl), replace = TRUE))

# concentrations are right-skewed; limma assumes normality
y <- log2(assay(se_spl, "conc"))

design <- model.matrix(~ 0 + group, data = colData(se_spl))
colnames(design) <- levels(se_spl$group)

fit <- lmFit(y, design)
fit <- contrasts.fit(fit, makeContrasts(trt - ctrl, levels = design))
fit <- eBayes(fit)

topTable(fit, number = 5)
```

Because
[`colData()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/SummarizedExperiment/man/SummarizedExperiment-class.html)
carries the full analysis annotation, covariates are available without
extra joins, for example blocking on batch with
`~ 0 + group + batch_id`.

### Lipid-specific analysis with lipidr

[lipidr](https://www.lipidr.org) works on a `LipidomicsExperiment`, a
subclass of `SummarizedExperiment`. Produce one directly:

``` r

le <- save_dataset_summarizedexperiment(
  mexp,
  variable = "intensity",
  as = "LipidomicsExperiment")
```

MRMhub fills in what lipidr requires: `Molecule` from `feature_id`,
`Class` from `feature_class`, `istd` from `is_istd`, plus the
`summarized` / `logged` / `normalized` flags lipidr reads but does
**not** validate; an object missing them constructs cleanly and then
misbehaves.

**Use a peak-area scale variable with lipidr, not concentrations.**
lipidr log-transforms with `log = TRUE` by default and **clamps values
below 1 to 1** first, which assumes Skyline peak-area magnitudes.
Concentrations in µmol/L are mostly below 1, so they are silently
flattened to `log2(1) = 0`;
[`eBayes()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/limma/man/ebayes.html) then reports
zero residual variances and every fold change collapses. MRMhub warns
when you export a mostly-sub-1 assay this way.

The trigger is absolute scale, not concentration as such: the clamp is a
fixed threshold at 1. If you need concentrations, pass `log = FALSE` to
lipidr, or log-transform them yourself beforehand.

``` r

library(lipidr)

le_spl <- le[!rowData(le)$istd, le$qc_type == "SPL"]
set.seed(1)
le_spl$group <- factor(
  sample(c("ctrl", "trt"), ncol(le_spl), replace = TRUE))

le_norm <- normalize_pqn(le_spl, measure = "intensity", log = TRUE)

de_results <- de_analysis(
  le_norm,
  trt - ctrl,
  measure = "intensity",
  group_col = "group")
plot_results_volcano(de_results, show.labels = FALSE)
```
