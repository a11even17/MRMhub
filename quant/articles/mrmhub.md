## Overview

MRMhub is a set of tools for reproducible raw data processing,
post-processing, quality control, and reporting of targeted quantitative
small-molecule mass spectrometry experiments using Multiple Reaction
Monitoring (MRM). The platform includes two complementary tools:

- **INTEGRATOR**: standalone application for automated peak detection,
  picking, and integration from mzML files.

- **QUANT**: R package providing a function library for data post-
  processing, including quantitation, data corrections, quality control,
  and reporting.

The modular functionalities and defined data structures support diverse
analytical designs, data formats, and processing tasks, as found in
metabolomics, lipidomics and other quantitative small molecule analyses.
`MRMhub` is intended for both analytical and bioinformatics scientists
and supports collaboration between them. It enables the creation of
efficient, customizable, supervisable, and documented end-to-end data
processing workflows through its functions and data objects.

## Usage

#### INTEGRATOR (Peak Integration)

To download the latest release of INTEGRATOR, visit the [Releases
page](https://github.com/SLINGhub/MRMhub/releases). Choose the
appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
and download the corresponding executable file. Unzip the downloaded
file and double-click the executable to launch the application. Refer to
the [Documentation](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/integrator/) for
detailed instructions on how to use INTEGRATOR.

#### QUANT (Postprocessing and Quality Control)

Install the `mrmhub` package from Github using the following command:

``` r

if (!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("SLINGhub/MRMhub")
library(mrmhub)
```

`pak` resolves locked packages and parallelises downloads;
`remotes::install_github("SLINGhub/MRMhub")` is an equivalent fallback.
For detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the
[Documentation](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/).
