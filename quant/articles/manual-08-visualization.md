# Visualisation functions

Manual

MRMhub provides plotting functions covering every stage of the workflow.
All functions return `ggplot2` objects (or, for paged outputs, a list of
`ggplot2` objects), so the standard ggplot2 grammar can be used to
further customise titles, themes, scales, and facets. The functions
below are grouped by the workflow stage at which they are most useful.

### Setup

``` r

library(mrmhub)
library(ggplot2)

mexp <- readRDS("results/mexp_processed.rds")
```

## Acquisition design

### `plot_runsequence()`: sequence overview

The run-sequence plot summarises the acquisition design: QC type
positions, batch boundaries, and the analysis timeline. It is an
experiment-level plot (no per-feature dimension).

``` r

plot_runsequence(mexp,
                 qc_types = NA,
                 show_batches = TRUE,
                 batch_zebra_stripe = TRUE,
                 show_timestamp = FALSE)
```

Set `show_timestamp = TRUE` to use the acquisition timestamp on the
x-axis; this helps identify interruptions between or within batches that
would not be visible against the analysis sequence number.

## Drift, batch, and per-feature inspection

### `plot_runscatter()`: values vs analysis order

The primary plot for drift and batch QC. Plots a feature variable
(intensity, normalised intensity, concentration) against the analysis
order, optionally with fitted drift trends from the correction
functions. Returns one panel per feature (paged).

``` r

plot_runscatter(mexp,
                variable = "norm_intensity",
                qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL"),
                rows_page = 1,
                cols_page = 3,
                show_trend = TRUE)
```

Use `variable = "intensity_before"` / `"conc_before"` to inspect
pre-correction values, and `variable = "intensity"` / `"conc"` for
post-correction. Setting `output_pdf = TRUE` and a `path` writes a
multi-page PDF, which is practical for large feature lists.

### `plot_abundanceprofile()`: feature abundance distribution

Shows the abundance distribution of each feature, grouped by class.
Useful for inspecting class coverage and identifying features at the
limits of the dynamic range.

``` r

plot_abundanceprofile(mexp,
                      variable = "intensity",
                      qc_types = "SPL",
                      log_scale = TRUE)
```

When `use_qc_metrics = TRUE`, the function reads from the pre-computed
`metrics_qc` table (much faster on large feature lists) and `qc_types`
must specify a single QC type.

## Normalisation QC

### `plot_rla_boxplot()`: relative log-abundance per analysis

A boxplot per analysis of `log2(value / median_across_analyses)`. Width
and centring of the box reflect injection-level variability. Useful
before and after normalisation to confirm that ISTD correction removes
injection-level bias.

``` r

plot_rla_boxplot(mexp,
                 variable = "norm_intensity",
                 qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL"))
```

### `plot_normalization_qc()`: before-vs-after comparison

Compares pre- and post-normalisation values for QC samples in three
layouts (`plot_type`): `"scatter"` (point cloud), `"diff"` (signed
difference), `"ratio"` (after / before). CV of QC samples should
decrease after normalisation; an increase typically indicates an
incorrect ISTD pairing.

``` r

plot_normalization_qc(mexp,
                      before_norm_var = "intensity",
                      after_norm_var  = "norm_intensity",
                      plot_type       = "scatter",
                      qc_types        = c("BQC", "SPL"),
                      facet_by_class  = TRUE,
                      cv_threshold_value = 25)
```

## Multivariate QC

### `plot_pca()`: score plot

Two-dimensional PCA score plot with confidence ellipses grouped by
`qc_type`, `batch_id`, or `"none"`. See [QC exploration with
PCA](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/tutorial-05-run-scatter.md)
for an interpretation walk-through.

``` r

plot_pca(mexp,
         variable          = "norm_intensity",
         qc_types          = c("BQC", "SPL"),
         ellipse_variable  = "qc_type")
```

### `plot_pca_loading()`: loadings

Loadings on the first two PCs. Features at the extremes drive sample
separation; a single feature dominating PC1 should be inspected with
[`plot_runscatter()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_runscatter.md)
before being attributed to biology.

``` r

plot_pca_loading(mexp,
                 variable = "norm_intensity",
                 qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL"))
```

### `plot_feature_correlations()`: correlation heatmap

Pairwise correlation matrix across features, useful for identifying
redundant transitions and flagging candidate isobaric interferences.

``` r

plot_feature_correlations(mexp,
                          variable = "norm_intensity",
                          qc_types = "SPL")
```

## QC metrics and filtering

### `plot_qcmetrics_comparison()`: pairwise QC-metric scatter

Plots one QC metric against another, computed across features. The
variable names follow the pattern `{variable}_cv_{qctype}`
(e.g. `intensity_cv_bqc`, `norm_intensity_cv_tqc`) and live in
`mexp@metrics_qc` after
[`calc_qc_metrics()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/calc_qc_metrics.md)
is run.

``` r

mexp <- calc_qc_metrics(mexp)

plot_qcmetrics_comparison(mexp,
                          plot_type        = "scatter",
                          x_variable       = "intensity_cv_bqc",
                          y_variable       = "norm_intensity_cv_bqc",
                          equality_line    = TRUE,
                          threshold_values = 25,
                          log_scale        = FALSE)
```

Points below the equality line indicate features for which CV was
reduced by normalisation; points above indicate features made worse,
typically a misassigned ISTD.

### `plot_qc_summary_byclass()` / `plot_qc_summary_overall()`: filter outcome

After
[`filter_features_qc()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/filter_features_qc.md),
these two functions summarise how many features passed each filter rule,
broken down by feature class (`_byclass`) or aggregated (`_overall`).

``` r

plot_qc_summary_overall(mexp)
plot_qc_summary_byclass(mexp)
```

## External calibration and response curves

### `plot_calibrationcurves()`: calibration fits

After
[`quantify_by_calibration()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/quantify_by_calibration.md),
plots calibration response vs concentration with the fitted model, the
calibration points, and points excluded from the fit. Returns a paged
grid of features.

``` r

plot_calibrationcurves(mexp,
                       variable = "norm_intensity",
                       qc_types = NA)
```

The fit model is taken from the calibration setup unless overridden with
`fit_overwrite = "linear"` or `"quadratic"`.

### `plot_responsecurves()`: RQC linearity

Plots feature response across an RQC dilution series. The fitted slope
and R² values report on the linearity of the assay in the range of the
QC pool. See
[`get_response_curve_stats()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/get_response_curve_stats.md)
for the numeric summary.

``` r

plot_responsecurves(mexp,
                    variable = "intensity")
```

## Method-specific checks

### `plot_rt_vs_chain()`: retention time vs chain length (lipidomics)

For lipidomics methods using class-based chromatography, plots RT
against carbon number, separated by class. Outliers from the expected
linear relationship within a class point to mis-identified features.

``` r

plot_rt_vs_chain(mexp)
```

### `plot_matrixeffects()`: matrix-effect overview

Compares ISTD response in matrix-containing QCs against solvent-only
injections to flag matrix-effect outliers.

``` r

plot_matrixeffects(mexp)
```

### `plot_interference_correction()`: interference annotations

QC overview for features with interference annotations (see
[Interference
correction](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/tutorial-11-interference-correction.md)).

``` r

plot_interference_correction(mexp)
```

## Customisation and export

Text size, legend placement and legend sizing are controlled directly
through shared arguments (`font_base_size`, `legend_position`,
`legend_size`, and, on the core QC plots, `strip_text_size`,
`show_legend_title`, `legend_bg_alpha`); paged and faceted plots size
their text and points automatically from `cols_page`. See [Customising
plots](#customising-plots) for the full argument reference.

### Customising plots

Every `plot_*()` function returns a `ggplot2` object built from a shared
house theme (faint grey gridlines, a thin panel border, dark-navy facet
strips). A small set of arguments exposes the common appearance choices,
so a balanced figure usually comes from the plotting call alone, without
a trailing `+ theme(...)`.

#### The shared arguments

Every plotting function accepts the three common arguments. The
higher-use QC plots
([`plot_pca()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_pca.md),
[`plot_pca_loading()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_pca_loading.md),
[`plot_runscatter()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_runscatter.md),
[`plot_rla_boxplot()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_rla_boxplot.md),
[`plot_normalization_qc()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_normalization_qc.md)
and
[`plot_qcmetrics_comparison()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_qcmetrics_comparison.md))
accept further arguments for finer legend and facet control.

| Argument | Applies to | Effect |
|----|----|----|
| `font_base_size` | all plots | Base font size in points; all plot text scales proportionally |
| `legend_position` | all plots | Legend placement (keyword, corner, or coordinate) |
| `legend_size` | all plots | Scales the whole legend: text, title, key and plotted symbols |
| `show_legend_title` | all plots | `FALSE` hides the legend title |
| `title` | all plots | A string sets the plot title; `NULL`/`NA` show none |
| `strip_text_size` | faceted plots | Facet strip label size |
| `strip_bg_color` | faceted plots | Facet strip background fill (strip text auto-contrasts light/dark) |
| `legend_bg_alpha` | core QC plots | Opacity of a white background box behind an inside legend |
| `aspect_ratio` | [`plot_pca()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_pca.md) | Panel aspect ratio; default `1` (square score plot) |

Arguments left at their default (`NULL`, or the per-function default)
leave that aspect of the plot at the house setting. Setting one
overrides only that property.

#### Setting defaults for a whole notebook

The same appearance choices can be made once, for every subsequent plot,
with
[`mrmhub_set_plot_defaults()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/mrmhub_set_plot_defaults.md),
convenient when a document targets a particular medium (a smaller base
font and point size for a dense multi-panel report, say) and the choice
should apply throughout without repeating it on each call.

``` r

mrmhub_set_plot_defaults(font_base_size = 8, point_size = 0.8)
```

The resolution order for every argument is: a value passed explicitly to
a plotting function wins, then the global default set here, then the
function’s built-in default (including the automatic `cols_page` sizing
on faceted plots). A one-off call therefore still overrides the global
setting:

``` r

# uses the global font_base_size = 8 set above
plot_pca(mexp, variable = "norm_intensity")

# this single plot overrides it
plot_pca(mexp, variable = "norm_intensity", font_base_size = 11)
```

[`mrmhub_get_plot_defaults()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/mrmhub_get_plot_defaults.md)
reports the active settings and
[`mrmhub_reset_plot_defaults()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/mrmhub_reset_plot_defaults.md)
clears them. The defaults are ordinary R options
(`mrmhub.font_base_size` and so on), so they can also be scoped to a
single section with
[`withr::local_options()`](https://withr.r-lib.org/reference/with_options.html)
rather than set for the whole session. The arguments that can be set
globally are `font_base_size`, `point_size`, `legend_position`,
`legend_size`, `show_legend_title`, `strip_bg_color`, and the `units`
and `dpi` used by
[`save_plot()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/save_plot.md)
(see [Setting the unit and resolution
once](#setting-the-unit-and-resolution-once)). Figure width and height
are deliberately not settable globally: the physical size of a saved
figure should be readable from the call that writes it.

#### Placing the legend

`legend_position` accepts the standard ggplot2 keywords, four corner
shortcuts for a legend drawn inside the panel, or a raw coordinate.

| Value | Result |
|----|----|
| `"right"`, `"left"`, `"top"`, `"bottom"` | Legend outside the panel on that side |
| `"none"` | No legend |
| `"inside-tr"`, `"inside-tl"`, `"inside-br"`, `"inside-bl"` | Inside the panel, anchored to that corner |
| `c(x, y)` | Inside the panel at that coordinate (`0`–`1`) |

All plots default to `"right"`. For a legend drawn inside the panel over
the points, a translucent background box (`legend_bg_alpha`) keeps it
readable:

``` r

plot_normalization_qc(mexp,
  before_norm_var = "intensity",
  after_norm_var  = "norm_intensity",
  plot_type       = "diff",
  legend_position = "inside-br",
  legend_bg_alpha = 0.6)
```

#### Sizing text and symbols

`font_base_size` is the single text knob: increasing it scales axis
text, titles, strip labels and the legend together. `legend_size` scales
the legend independently: its text, title, key box, and the plotted
symbol (the glyph in the key, which a plain `legend.key.size` does not
resize). A value of `3` or less is read as a multiplier of
`font_base_size`; a larger value is an absolute point size.
`strip_text_size` follows the same convention for facet labels.

``` r

plot_rt_vs_chain(mexp,
  font_base_size  = 6,
  legend_position = "right",
  legend_size     = 0.8)     # legend text and glyphs at 6 * 0.8 pt
```

#### Automatic sizing on paged and faceted plots

Plots that lay panels out in a grid
([`plot_runscatter()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_runscatter.md),
[`plot_responsecurves()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_responsecurves.md),
[`plot_qcmetrics_comparison()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_qcmetrics_comparison.md),
[`plot_normalization_qc()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_normalization_qc.md)
and
[`plot_rt_vs_chain()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_rt_vs_chain.md))
size their text and points from the number of facet columns, since
column count is the main driver of panel size. With `autoscale = TRUE`
(the default), `font_base_size` and `point_size` left unset are filled
from `cols_page`:

| `cols_page` | `font_base_size` | `point_size` |
|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1–2         | 9                | 1.0          |
| 3           | 7                | 0.7          |
| 4–5         | 6                | 0.5          |
| 6 or more   | 5                | 0.4          |

A value passed explicitly always wins, so autoscaling only fills what is
left unset:

``` r

# 3-column page: text and points sized automatically
plot_runscatter(mexp, variable = "norm_intensity", cols_page = 3)

# keep the automatic font, but set the point size by hand
plot_runscatter(mexp, variable = "norm_intensity", cols_page = 3,
                point_size = 1.2)
```

Setting `autoscale = FALSE` ignores the grid and uses the single-plot
defaults (`font_base_size = 11`, `point_size = 1.5`) for anything left
unset. Single-panel plots such as
[`plot_pca()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_pca.md)
and
[`plot_matrixeffects()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_matrixeffects.md)
use `font_base_size = 11` by default.

### ggplot2 layering

All functions return `ggplot2` objects, so anything the arguments above
do not cover (bespoke themes, scales, titles) can be appended in the
usual way, and a trailing
[`theme()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html)
overrides the house theme.

``` r

plot_runscatter(mexp, variable = "norm_intensity", qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL")) +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal(base_size = 9) +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "Normalised intensity (BQC vs SPL)")
```

### Saving plots

[`save_plot()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/save_plot.md)
writes any plot to a file at a defined physical size and resolution.
Sizes are given in `mm` by default, matching how journals specify figure
widths, and `cm`, `in`, `pt` and `px` are also accepted.

``` r

p <- plot_pca(mexp,
              variable = "norm_intensity",
              qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL"),
              ellipse_variable = "batch_id")

save_plot(p, "figures/pca_batch.pdf", width = 180, height = 120)
```

The same figure can be written in several formats in one call. Give a
path without an extension and list the formats; each file gets the
matching extension.

``` r

save_plot(p, "figures/pca_batch", format = c("pdf", "png"), width = 180, height = 120)
```

The plot is returned visibly, so piping into
[`save_plot()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/save_plot.md)
still renders the figure in the notebook and saving needs no separate
line:

``` r

plot_pca(mexp, variable = "norm_intensity", ellipse_variable = "batch_id") |>
  save_plot("figures/pca_batch.pdf", width = 180, height = 120)
```

In a script or a loop, where re-drawing a dense figure is wasted work,
`show_plot = FALSE` skips it and returns the written paths instead:

``` r

paths <- save_plot(p, "figures/pca_batch.pdf", width = 180, height = 120,
                   show_plot = FALSE)
```

(With `show_plot = TRUE` the paths are still available, as the `"paths"`
attribute of the returned plot.)

[`save_plot()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/save_plot.md)
also accepts what the plot functions return around a plot: the result
list of
[`plot_rla_boxplot()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_rla_boxplot.md)
(it picks up the `plot` element), a `patchwork` composition, and a list
of plots, which becomes a multi-page PDF.

``` r

pages <- plot_runscatter(mexp, variable = "norm_intensity", return_plots = TRUE)
save_plot(pages, "figures/runscatter_all.pdf", width = 280, height = 200,
          show_plot = FALSE)
```

#### Choosing a format

| Purpose | Format | Device used | Typical `dpi` |
|----|----|----|----|
| Journal figure, vector (default choice) | `"pdf"` | [`grDevices::cairo_pdf`](https://rdrr.io/r/grDevices/cairo.html), else [`grDevices::pdf`](https://rdrr.io/r/grDevices/pdf.html) | n/a |
| Figure for further editing (Illustrator, Inkscape) | `"svg"` | [`svglite::svglite`](https://svglite.r-lib.org/reference/svglite.html), else [`grDevices::svg`](https://rdrr.io/r/grDevices/cairo.html) | n/a |
| Slides, Quarto HTML, GitHub | `"png"` | [`ragg::agg_png`](https://ragg.r-lib.org/reference/agg_png.html), else [`grDevices::png`](https://rdrr.io/r/grDevices/png.html) | 150–300 |
| Journal requiring raster submission | `"tiff"` | [`ragg::agg_tiff`](https://ragg.r-lib.org/reference/agg_tiff.html), else [`grDevices::tiff`](https://rdrr.io/r/grDevices/png.html) | 300–600 |

Prefer a **vector** format for publication: text stays selectable and
searchable, and lines stay sharp at any magnification.

Prefer a **raster** format when a plot draws very many marks — a
[`plot_runscatter()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_runscatter.md)
page covering several thousand analyses, or a dense
[`plot_pca()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_pca.md)
score plot. Every point becomes a separate object in a PDF, so such
figures produce very large files that are slow to open and to typeset.
Saving them at 300–600 dpi instead keeps the file small with no visible
loss.

The optional packages `ragg` and `svglite` are used automatically when
installed, giving better text rendering, system-font support and smaller
SVG files. Without them the equivalent `grDevices` device is used and
the output is still correct. Installing both is recommended:
`install.packages(c("ragg", "svglite"))`.

PDF output uses the cairo device wherever R was built with cairo
support, because plain
[`grDevices::pdf()`](https://rdrr.io/r/grDevices/pdf.html) writes text
in a single-byte encoding and silently transliterates anything outside
it — an en dash becomes `-`, and `≥` becomes `>=`. Unit labels such as
`µmol/L` and statistical annotations depend on those glyphs surviving.

#### Setting the unit and resolution once

`units` and `dpi` can be set for a whole notebook through
[`mrmhub_set_plot_defaults()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/mrmhub_set_plot_defaults.md),
so only `width` and `height` need repeating. The size itself is always
explicit at the call site.

``` r

mrmhub_set_plot_defaults(units = "mm", dpi = 600)

save_plot(p, "figures/pca_batch.png", width = 180, height = 120)   # 600 dpi
```

#### Multi-page PDFs

For paged outputs
([`plot_runscatter()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_runscatter.md),
[`plot_calibrationcurves()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_calibrationcurves.md),
[`plot_responsecurves()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_responsecurves.md),
[`plot_feature_correlations()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_feature_correlations.md)),
the built-in `output_pdf = TRUE` and `path` arguments write a multi-page
PDF directly, rather than iterating in user code. `page_width` and
`page_height` set the page size; without them an A4 page is used,
oriented by `page_orientation`.

``` r

plot_runscatter(mexp,
                variable    = "norm_intensity",
                qc_types    = c("BQC", "SPL"),
                output_pdf  = TRUE,
                path        = "figures/runscatter_all.pdf",
                page_width  = 297,
                page_height = 210)
```

### Combining plots

`patchwork` composes multiple panels into a single figure:

``` r

library(patchwork)

p_seq  <- plot_runsequence(mexp)
p_pca  <- plot_pca(mexp, variable = "norm_intensity",
                   qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL"), ellipse_variable = "batch_id")
p_rla  <- plot_rla_boxplot(mexp, variable = "norm_intensity",
                           qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL"))

p_seq / (p_pca | p_rla)
```
