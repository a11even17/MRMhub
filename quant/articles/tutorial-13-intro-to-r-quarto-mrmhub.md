# Introduction to R, Quarto, and MRMhub

Tutorial Beginner

A MRMhub analysis is written as a document that mixes prose with the R
code that produces the results, so the report and the analysis are one
file. This tutorial assumes no prior experience with R or Quarto. It
starts from an empty computer, installs the software, sets up a project,
and then runs a complete analysis of the bundled demonstration data —
importing, normalizing, plotting, and exporting — using MRMhub functions
alone, without any custom R code. After working through it you can open
a fresh Quarto document and reproduce the same workflow on your own
data.

## 1. Install R and an editor

Two pieces of software are needed. **R** is the language the analysis
runs in; an **integrated development environment** (IDE) is the editor
you write and run it in.

- Install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (newest version).
  Pick the download for your OS and accept the defaults.
- Install an IDE. [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
  is the most common choice and the one this tutorial follows.
  [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) is a great alternative built on
  VS Code.

With R and RStudio installed, open RStudio and install MRMhub from the
console (the bottom-left pane). The first line installs `pak`, a package
installer; the second uses it to fetch MRMhub and its dependencies:

``` r

if (!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("SLINGhub/MRMhub")
```

If the installation reports an error, the [Installation
guide](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/manual-00-installation.md)
lists the common causes (a missing compiler on Windows or macOS, a
firewall blocking the download) and their fixes.

## 2. Create a Quarto project

A **project** keeps everything for one analysis — data, code, and
results — in a single folder that the IDE treats as a unit. In RStudio,
choose *File → New Project → New Directory → Quarto Project*, give it a
name, and create it. Quarto’s [project
documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/rstudio/) covers the dialog
in detail.

Inside the new project, add two folders to keep raw inputs separate from
generated results — the convention MRMhub’s own workflows follow:

    my_study/
    ├── data/            # raw INTEGRATOR output and metadata files
    ├── output/          # exported CSVs, PDFs, and reports
    └── analysis.qmd     # this document

A Quarto document (`.qmd`) is the home for the workflow: it interleaves
explanatory text with code, documenting each decision alongside the
result it produces.

## 3. Add text and code

A `.qmd` file is plain text with two kinds of content. **Prose** is
written in Markdown — the same ordinary syntax used across the web,
where `#` starts a heading, `**bold**` sets bold text, and `-` begins a
list item. **Code** lives in *chunks*: R code fenced between
```` ```{r} ```` and ```` ``` ````. In RStudio, *Insert → Code Chunk*
(or Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I) adds an empty one.

```` markdown
Some explanatory text describing the next step.


``` r
1 + 1
[1] 2
```

More text explaining what comes next, then a second chunk that builds on the first.


``` r
2 + 2
[1] 4
```
````

The word after `r` — `first-step`, `second-step` above — is an optional
label naming the chunk.

RStudio offers two ways to edit a `.qmd`: the **Source** editor shows
the raw Markdown, and the **Visual** editor a formatted,
word-processor-like view. Both edit the same file; Quarto’s [authoring
guide](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)
introduces both.

A chunk’s behaviour is set by **cell options** — lines at the top of the
chunk, each prefixed with `#|`, written as `#| option: value`. A handful
cover almost every need in an analysis document:

- `#| echo: false` — run the chunk but hide its source code, showing
  only the result.
- `#| eval: false` — show the code without running it (useful for an
  export step you don’t want re-run on every render).
- `#| message: true` — keep the chunk’s messages, including MRMhub’s
  coloured step-by-step console feedback; `#| warning: false` hides
  warnings.
- `#| fig-width:` and `#| fig-height:` — the width and height of a
  figure, in inches. Set them per chunk here, or once for the whole
  document in the YAML header; [Quarto
  workflows](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/manual-11-quarto-workflows.md)
  explains how these interact with MRMhub’s plot sizing.

The [Quarto
documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html)
is the complete reference.

## 4. Preview and run code

There are two distinct actions. **Running a chunk** executes its code
immediately and shows the result inline, right beneath the chunk. Each
chunk carries a small toolbar at its top-right: the green ▶ arrow runs
that chunk, the ⬇ beside it first runs every earlier chunk, and the ⚙
opens the chunk’s options. Pressing Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Enter with the
cursor inside the chunk does the same as ▶. **Rendering** turns the
whole document into a finished HTML (or PDF) report: click the 📄
**Render** button in the editor toolbar to run every chunk in order and
assemble the output. The **Preview** that opens updates on each render,
so the report stays in step with the code.

While developing an analysis, run chunks one at a time to check each
step; render at the end to produce the shareable report.

## 5. The setup chunk

The first chunk of an analysis loads the packages and sets defaults that
apply throughout. Loading MRMhub makes its functions available;
[`mrmhub_enable_cli_color()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/mrmhub_enable_cli_color.md)
colours the console messages in the rendered report; and
[`mrmhub_set_plot_defaults()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/mrmhub_set_plot_defaults.md)
sets a house font size and resolution for every figure, so individual
plots need not repeat them.

``` r

library(mrmhub)
mrmhub_enable_cli_color()
mrmhub_set_plot_defaults(font_base_size = 8)
```

## 6. Load the data

Every analysis begins with a `MRMhubExperiment` — the container that
holds the data and every result computed from it (see [The
MRMhubExperiment
object](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/manual-02-data-object.md)).
We create an empty one and import the demonstration dataset bundled with
the package. Using
[`system.file()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/system.file.html) locates that
file wherever the package is installed, so the code runs unchanged on
any machine; in your own project you would instead give the path to a
file in `data/`.

``` r

demo_file <- system.file("extdata", "MRMhub_demo.tsv", package = "mrmhub")

mexp <- MRMhubExperiment()
mexp <- import_data_mrmhub(
  mexp,
  path = demo_file,
  import_metadata = TRUE)
```

    ✔ Imported 499 analyses with 28 features.

    ℹ feature_area selected as default feature intensity. Modify with `set_intensity_var()`.

    ✔ Analysis metadata associated with 499 analyses.

    ✔ Feature metadata associated with 28 features.

Setting `import_metadata = TRUE` reads the sample and internal-standard
annotations embedded in the INTEGRATOR file at the same time. MRMhub
reads several other formats; [Importing analytical
data](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/manual-04-data-import.md)
has a decision flowchart and the full importer reference.

## 7. Process the data

The core processing step normalizes each feature to its assigned
internal standard, which corrects for extraction and injection
variation. The result is stored in the `feature_norm_intensity`
variable, leaving the raw intensities untouched.

``` r

mexp <- normalize_by_istd(mexp)
```

    ✔ 19 features normalized with 9 ISTDs in 499 analyses.

This is the shortest useful pipeline. A real study usually adds drift
and batch correction and QC filtering in a set order; [A basic MRMhub
workflow](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/tutorial-02-basic-workflow.md)
and [Drift and batch
correction](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/tutorial-04-drift-correction.md)
build on the object from here. If you would rather not write this code
by hand,
[`build_workflow()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/build_workflow.md)
opens an interactive application that validates your data and metadata
and generates an equivalent Quarto document to download (see [Build a
workflow without
code](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/tutorial-12-workflow-builder.md)).

## 8. Check the processing status

[`mrmhub_status()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/mrmhub_status.md)
prints a full report of the object: what was imported, which steps have
run, and which stages still lie ahead. It is the quickest way to confirm
the experiment is in the state you expect before moving on to plots and
export.

``` r

mrmhub_status(mexp)
```

## 9. Plot signals across the run

A run-scatter plot shows each feature’s signal against injection order —
a quick check for trends or outliers. We plot the raw peak areas for two
lipid classes, selected by a regular expression on their names.

``` r

plot_runscatter(
  mexp,
  variable = "intensity",
  include_feature_filter = "^(Cer|PC)",
  rows_page = 2, cols_page = 3)
```

![Run-scatter of raw peak areas for Cer and PC features by injection
order](tutorial-13-intro-to-r-quarto-mrmhub_files/figure-html/runscatter-1.png)

Figure 1. Raw peak areas of Cer and PC features across injection order.

![Run-scatter of raw peak areas for Cer and PC features by injection
order](tutorial-13-intro-to-r-quarto-mrmhub_files/figure-html/runscatter-2.png)

Figure 1. Raw peak areas of Cer and PC features across injection order.

To save the plot to a file instead of showing it,
[`plot_runscatter()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_runscatter.md)
can write a multi-page PDF — one page per grid of features — directly to
`output/`:

``` r

plot_runscatter(
  mexp,
  variable = "intensity",
  include_feature_filter = "^(Cer|PC)",
  rows_page = 2, cols_page = 3,
  output_pdf = TRUE,
  path = "output/runscatter.pdf")
```

## 10. Run a PCA

A principal-component analysis (PCA) summarises all features at once,
placing each sample in a plane so that similar samples fall close
together — useful for spotting QC clustering or outliers.

``` r

plot_pca(mexp, variable = "norm_intensity")
```

![PCA score plot of samples coloured by QC
type](tutorial-13-intro-to-r-quarto-mrmhub_files/figure-html/pca-1.png)

Figure 2. PCA of the normalized intensities, coloured by QC type.

To keep a copy of the figure, pipe it into
[`save_plot()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/save_plot.md).
Because
[`save_plot()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/save_plot.md)
returns the plot visibly, one line both writes the PDF and still renders
the figure in the report; `width` and `height` are in millimetres:

``` r

plot_pca(mexp, variable = "norm_intensity") |>
  save_plot("output/pca.pdf", width = 180, height = 120)
```

Giving
[`save_plot()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/save_plot.md)
a path with no extension and `format = c("pdf", "png")` writes both
formats at once; [Visualisation
functions](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/manual-08-visualization.md)
lists the plots available at each stage.

## 11. Export results

Finally, export the results for downstream use. A single-variable CSV
gives a plain table of normalized intensities, and
[`save_report_xlsx()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/save_report_xlsx.md)
writes a multi-sheet Excel workbook holding every data table and QC
metric in one file.

``` r

save_dataset_csv(
  mexp,
  path = "output/norm_intensities.csv",
  variable = "norm_intensity")

save_report_xlsx(
  mexp,
  path = "output/report.xlsx",
  filtered_variable = "norm_intensity")
```

With these chunks written, click **Render** once more: RStudio runs the
whole analysis top to bottom and produces a self-contained report, with
the CSV, PDFs, and Excel workbook waiting in `output/`.
