# Troubleshooting and FAQ

Manual

Common errors and questions, grouped by workflow stage. For installation
problems,
[`check_setup()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/check_setup.md)
reports what the R environment is missing; unresolved bugs belong on
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SLINGhub/MRMhub/issues).

## Installation and setup

**Q: How do I confirm my R environment is ready for MRMhub?**

**A:**
[`check_setup()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/check_setup.md)
checks the R version (≥ 4.1.0 is required), the packages MRMhub needs,
and the optional packages that unlock extra features. Missing required
packages are listed with a copy-pasteable install command.

``` r

check_setup()
```

**Q:
[`build_workflow()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/build_workflow.md)
reports that shiny or bslib is not installed.**

**A:** The Workflow Builder is an optional feature, so `shiny` and
`bslib` are not installed with MRMhub. Run interactively,
[`build_workflow()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/build_workflow.md)
offers to install them; otherwise add them yourself.

``` r

install.packages(c("shiny", "bslib"))
```

If instead it reports *“Could not find the workflow builder app. Try
reinstalling mrmhub.”*, the app files are missing from the installed
package — reinstall MRMhub.

**Q: On Windows, installation fails with *“cannot remove prior
installation of package ‘X’”* or *“permission denied”*.**

**A:** A dependency’s DLL is locked by another running R session,
RStudio, or Positron, and *Restart R* does not always release the lock
on Windows. Quit the IDE entirely (close all windows), confirm no
`R.exe`/`Rterm.exe` is left in Task Manager, reopen, and run the install
command before opening any project that auto-attaches a tidyverse
package.

**Q: *“namespace ‘rlang’ is already loaded”* (or another core
package).**

**A:** A package that others depend on is pinned in the current
namespace. Restart R, update the named package first in the fresh
session, then retry.

``` r

install.packages("rlang")
```

**Q: After updating MRMhub, a function fails with *“lazy-load database
‘…/mrmhub.rdb’ is corrupt”*.**

**A:** The package was reinstalled while it was loaded in the running
session, so R still holds the index of the previous installation and
looks up functions at offsets that no longer match the new file on disk.
Nothing is actually damaged. Restart R and attach the package again.

``` r

library(mrmhub)
```

Restarting R after every install or update of MRMhub avoids this. In
RStudio and Positron, *Session ▸ Restart R* (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+F10).

**Q: *“Rtools is required to build R packages”* (Windows).**

**A:** Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
matching your R version (Rtools43 for R 4.3, Rtools44 for R 4.4, …),
restart R, and retry. Rtools compiles the source packages a few
dependencies still need when no Windows binary is available yet.

**Q: *“Could not find tools necessary to compile a package”* (macOS).**

**A:** Install the Xcode command line tools with
`xcode-select --install` in a Terminal, accept the dialog, and retry in
a fresh session. `mrmhub` contains no compiled code; the requirement
comes from the installer, so `remotes` is an alternative to `pak` here.

**Q: `remotes` keeps failing on a locked or transitive dependency.**

**A:** [`pak`](https://pak.r-lib.org/) resolves the dependency graph in
one pass, handles locked packages more cleanly on Windows, and gives
clearer messages on transitive failures.

``` r

install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("SLINGhub/mrmhub")
```

**Q: *“installation of package ‘X’ had non-zero exit status”*.**

**A:** By default every optional (Suggests) dependency is installed too,
so one broken optional package aborts the whole install. Install only
the strictly required dependencies and add optional ones later.

``` r

remotes::install_github(
  "SLINGhub/mrmhub",
  dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo")
)
```

## Importing data

**Q: Which importer should I use?**

**A:** See [Import and prepare data
files](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/manual-04-data-import.md)
for a decision flowchart matching each vendor/file layout to its
importer.

**Q:
[`import_data_masshunter()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/import_data_masshunter.md)
aborts with *“Data file is in an unsupported or corrupted format…”*.**

**A:** Almost always the wrong importer for the file — a plain, Skyline,
or INTEGRATOR CSV passed to the MassHunter parser. Use the importer that
matches the file’s format. If the file really is a MassHunter export,
re-export it from MH Quant with compounds as columns.

**Q: An importer aborts with *“Required `analysis_id` column is
missing”* (or `feature_id`).**

**A:** The column holding the analysis or feature identifier was not
recognised. Map it explicitly with `column_mapping` (names are matched
case-insensitively).

``` r

import_data_csv_long(
  mexp,
  path = "your_file.csv",
  column_mapping = c(analysis_id = "Sample", feature_id = "Compound")
)
```

**Q: *“The file was read as a single column using the ‘,’ delimiter.”***

**A:** The file is semicolon- or tab-delimited (common in European Excel
locales), so a comma reader sees one column. Re-export as *CSV UTF-8
(Comma delimited)* and re-import.

**Q: *“Imported data measures the same feature more than once in the
same analysis.”***

**A:** Read the values in the message. **Identical** values mean the
same data was read twice (the same result file, or an overlapping part
of it). **Differing** values mean two real measurements carry the same
IDs: two injections sharing a `raw_data_filename` (the default
`analysis_id`), or the wrong column mapped to
`analysis_id`/`feature_id`.

**Q: A wide CSV aborts with *“All columns with feature values must be
numeric.”***

**A:** Metadata columns are mixed into the feature block. Point
`first_feature_column` at the first real feature column, and pass
`na_strings` for any text missing-value tokens.

``` r

import_data_csv_wide(
  mexp,
  path = "your_file.csv",
  first_feature_column = 5,
  na_strings = c("NA", "n.a.", "")
)
```

**Q: Skyline import aborts with *“`Molecule Name` is not unique
identifier for each transition.”***

**A:** Several transitions share a molecule name. Build unique IDs from
the precursor/product names or masses.

``` r

import_data_skyline(
  mexp,
  path = "your_file.csv",
  transition_id_columns = "name"
)
```

**Q: Feature names in the data don’t match the feature annotation.**

**A:** Trailing whitespace or case differences (`"Compound A "` vs
`"Compound A"`) break the join. Compare both directions:

``` r

data_ids  <- unique(mexp@dataset$feature_id)
annot_ids <- mexp@annot_features$feature_id
setdiff(data_ids, annot_ids)  # in data, not annotated
setdiff(annot_ids, data_ids)  # annotated, not in data
```

## Adding metadata

**Q: *“None of the analyses in the data match the imported analysis
metadata.”***

**A:** Either the wrong metadata file, or the `analysis_id`s are
formatted differently in the two sources. Import strips raw-file
extensions and squishes whitespace, so a residual mismatch means the IDs
genuinely differ — compare them with
[`setdiff()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sets.html) as above.

**Q: *“Not all analyses in the data have corresponding metadata.”***

**A:** Some analyses have no row in the analysis metadata. Add the
missing rows, or import with `excl_unmatched_analyses = TRUE` to drop
the unannotated analyses.

**Q: The metadata import aborts on validation warnings.**

**A:** A validation report is printed, then *“Please verify warnings in
corresponding metadata. Use `ignore_warnings = TRUE` to ignore
warnings.”* Fix the flagged issues, or re-import with
`ignore_warnings = TRUE`. A hard *“Metadata validation failed — see the
report above.”* (duplicate IDs, missing mandatory values) cannot be
bypassed and must be corrected.

## Processing

**Q: Normalised intensities come back `NA`.**

**A:**
[`normalize_by_istd()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/normalize_by_istd.md)
aborts by default when a feature has no internal standard assigned
(*“…no ISTD was defined…”*), or when no feature carries an
`istd_feature_id` at all (*“No ISTDs defined in feature metadata.”*).
Find the unassigned features, then assign an `istd_feature_id` to each —
or pass `ignore_missing_annotation = TRUE` to set them to `NA` and
continue.

``` r

mexp@annot_features |>
  dplyr::select(feature_id, istd_feature_id) |>
  dplyr::filter(is.na(istd_feature_id))
```

**Q: *“Data needs to be ISTD normalized, please run ‘normalize_by_istd’
first.”***

**A:** Quantitation and drift/batch correction on normalised or
concentration variables run after normalisation. Run
[`normalize_by_istd()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/normalize_by_istd.md)
before
[`quantify_by_istd()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/quantify_by_istd.md)
or
[`quantify_by_calibration()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/quantify_by_calibration.md).

**Q: *“Acquisition timestamps are not present in analysis results.”***

**A:** The vendor export carries no acquisition time, so
[`set_analysis_order()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/set_analysis_order.md)
cannot order by `"timestamp"`. Order by the result-file name or by a
column in the metadata instead.

``` r

set_analysis_order(mexp, order_by = "resultfile")
```

**Q: Drift or batch correction aborts with *“One or more specified
`qc_types` are not present in the dataset.”***

**A:** The reference QC label has no matching rows — a misspelled QC
type, no such QC samples in the run, or
[`add_metadata()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/add_metadata.md)
was not run so `qc_type` is still empty. Drift and batch correction fit
on QC samples only, so a valid QC type must be present.

**Q: Correction fails with *“Normalized intensities not available”* or
*“Concentration data are not available”*.**

**A:** You asked to correct a variable that has not been produced yet.
Run the upstream step first
([`normalize_by_istd()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/normalize_by_istd.md),
then a `quantify_*()`), or correct `variable = "intensity"`.

**Q: *“Batch correction was not applied as there is only one batch.”***

**A:** Between-batch correction needs more than one `batch_id`. With a
single batch there is nothing to centre — skip it and run the rest of
the pipeline normally.

**Q: Drift correction makes the data worse.**

**A:** Loess fitting needs enough evenly-spaced QC samples per batch;
with too few, or when the QC trend is flat (noise, not drift), the fit
can add variance. Inspect the QC trend before correcting, and skip drift
correction for batches where it is flat.

``` r

plot_runscatter(
  mexp,
  variable = "norm_intensity",
  qc_types = c("BQC", "SPL"),
  include_feature_filter = "your_feature"
)
```

## Quantitation and calibration

**Q:
[`quantify_by_istd()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/quantify_by_istd.md)
aborts about missing ISTD concentrations or amounts.**

**A:** ISTD quantitation needs internal-standard concentrations plus
per-analysis amounts. Import ISTD metadata (`annot_istds`) with
concentrations in nmol/L or ng/mL, and make sure `sample_amount` and
`istd_volume` are present in the analysis metadata. Missing amounts can
be tolerated with `ignore_missing_annotation = TRUE`.

**Q: *“Calibration curve data missing…”***

**A:** No calibrator samples and no concentrations are annotated. Flag
the calibrator analyses with `qc_type = "CAL"` in the analysis metadata,
and supply their known concentrations in the QC-concentration metadata
(`annot_qcconcentrations`).

**Q: *“Calibration curve annotations for N features are missing.”***

**A:** Those features have no concentrations in
`annot_qcconcentrations`, which is keyed on `sample_id` and
`analyte_id`. Add the missing entries, or skip those features with
`ignore_missing_annotation = TRUE`.

**Q: A calibration curve has R² \< 0.9.**

**A:** Inspect the fits, then try removing outlier calibration points,
switching `fit_model` (`"linear"`/`"quadratic"`) or `fit_weighting`
(`"none"`, `"1/x"`, `"1/x^2"`) — globally or per feature via the
`curve_fit_model` / `curve_fit_weighting` metadata columns — and check
for saturation at high concentrations.

``` r

get_calibration_metrics(mexp) |>
  dplyr::filter(r2 < 0.9)
```

## QC and filtering

**Q: What do the QC metrics mean?**

| Metric     | Meaning                                  | Typical threshold |
|------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| CV (%)     | Coefficient of variation in QC samples   | \< 20–30%         |
| Bias (%)   | Systematic deviation from expected value | \< 20%            |
| n_detected | Number of QC samples with signal         | ≥ 50–67% of QCs   |

**Q: All my features are filtered out.**

**A:**
[`filter_features_qc()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/filter_features_qc.md)
requires you to state `include_qualifier` and `include_istd` explicitly.
If every feature then fails the thresholds it raises no error —
`dataset_filtered` simply comes back empty, and the next step aborts
with *“Data has not been QC-filtered.”* Inspect the metrics and loosen
the thresholds.

``` r

mexp <- filter_features_qc(
  mexp,
  include_qualifier = FALSE,
  include_istd = FALSE,
  max.cv.normintensity.bqc = 40,
  max.prop.missing.normintensity.spl = 0.5
)
```

## Working with the object

**Q: The pipeline does not run through, or the results look wrong.**

**A:** A common cause is an inconsistent object name across chunks —
assigning a step to one name but running the next step on another (a
typo, or mixing `mexp` and `myexp`). Because every function takes and
returns the `MRMhubExperiment`, a mismatched name quietly processes an
earlier or wrong object instead of raising an error. Use a single name
throughout, assign each step back to it, and confirm with
[`mrmhub_status()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/mrmhub_status.md)
that the steps you expect have run.

**Q: How do I extract the final data as a data frame?**

**A:**
[`get_analyticaldata()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/get_analyticaldata.md)
returns the metadata-joined working table; the filtered table is a slot.

``` r

final <- get_analyticaldata(mexp, annotated = TRUE)
final_filtered <- mexp@dataset_filtered
```

**Q: How do I check what processing has been applied?**

**A:** The status flags record it.

``` r

mexp@is_istd_normalized
mexp@is_quantitated
mexp@var_drift_corrected
mexp@var_batch_corrected
```

**Q: How do I go back to the original data?**

**A:** The raw import is always preserved in `dataset_orig`. Restoring
it resets the working table (which drops the processing columns added
since import).

``` r

mexp@dataset <- mexp@dataset_orig
```

## Workflow Builder

**Q: Some processing steps are greyed out with a yellow badge.**

**A:** Steps are gated by the metadata you imported; the badge names
what is missing — *No feature metadata*, *No ISTDs defined*, *No ISTD
concentrations*, *No QC concentrations*, *No sample_id metadata*, or
*Only one batch*. Import the metadata that step needs (or, for the batch
step, a run with more than one batch) to enable it.

**Q: A banner says *“N things to check before this will run.”***

**A:** The builder pre-checks each selected step. Amber means warnings
only — it still generates the workflow; red means errors to fix first.
Open *Show details* to see each message, then import the missing
metadata or select the upstream step it names.

**Q: The banner says *“Configure your columns.”***

**A:** A generic long/wide CSV cannot be read until its columns are
mapped. Click *Configure columns…* at the top of the sidebar, map the
identifier and value columns, and *Apply* — the sidebar then shows
*columns configured*.

**Q: Which metadata source do I choose, and why did *“Embedded in the
data file”* disappear?**

**A:** There are four sources: embedded in the data file, an MSOrganiser
workbook, separate metadata tables (one `.xlsx`), or none for now. The
app probes your uploaded file and only offers *Embedded* when the data
actually carries in-file metadata columns; when it does not, that option
is removed — use one of the workbook routes.

**Q: A red banner says *“Import failed:”***

**A:** The importer threw while reading your files. The most common
causes are the wrong importer for the file’s format, or a
non-MSOrganiser workbook (or an unsupported template version) fed to the
MSOrganiser route. The message after *“Import failed:”* is the
underlying error — see the import and metadata sections above.

**Q: I clicked *Browse…* and nothing happened.**

**A:** The native file and folder pickers only work when the app runs
locally with a system dialog available. On a server or headless session
there is no picker — type or paste the path into the text field instead.

**Q: Will my large INTEGRATOR file upload?**

**A:** Yes, up to 500 MB (the app raises Shiny’s default 5 MB cap). The
data input accepts `.csv`, `.tsv`, and `.txt`; Excel files are only for
the metadata routes.

**Q: Did the app run my analysis?**

**A:** No — the Workflow Builder validates your inputs and generates a
Quarto workflow (`mrmhub_workflow.qmd`); it never runs the pipeline.
Download or copy the `.qmd`, then render it yourself.

``` bash
quarto render mrmhub_workflow.qmd
```

**Q: How do I try it without my own data?**

**A:** *Try the example* loads the bundled demo dataset (with embedded
metadata) so you can reach a green *Ready to render* banner end to end.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I change the default text size, point size, or legend in
plots?**

**A:**
[`mrmhub_set_plot_defaults()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/mrmhub_set_plot_defaults.md)
sets session-wide defaults for the shared appearance arguments of the
`plot_*()` functions, so you can set them once at the top of a notebook
instead of on every call.

``` r

mrmhub_set_plot_defaults(font_base_size = 8, point_size = 0.8)
```

It also accepts `legend_position`, `legend_size`, `show_legend_title`,
and `strip_bg_color`; a value passed directly to a plotting function
always wins.
[`mrmhub_get_plot_defaults()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/mrmhub_get_plot_defaults.md)
shows the active settings and
[`mrmhub_reset_plot_defaults()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/mrmhub_reset_plot_defaults.md)
clears them. See [Customising
plots](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/manual-08-visualization.html#customising-plots)
for the full reference.

**Q: Can I use MRMhub with non-MRM data (PRM, SRM)?**

**A:** Yes, provided the data can be formatted as a long CSV with
feature IDs and peak areas. The processing is agnostic to acquisition
mode.

**Q: Can I process only one batch?**

**A:** Yes. Skip batch correction; every other function works with
single-batch data.

**Q: Is there a size limit?**

**A:** No hard limit, but very large datasets are slower in the drift
and batch steps. If needed, process batches separately and merge.

**Q: Where do I report bugs?**

**A:** [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SLINGhub/MRMhub/issues).
