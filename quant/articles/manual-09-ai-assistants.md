# Getting help from an AI assistant

Manual

## Who this is for

You run targeted MS assays and have a chat assistant open – Claude
Desktop, ChatGPT, or a model running on your own machine – and you would
like it to help with the analysis in MRMhub QUANT. You may write a
little R, or none at all.

An assistant can genuinely help here, but only if you set it up
correctly. Out of the box it has read very little about a specialised,
young package like MRMhub, so it tends to guess. This page shows the
everyday tasks it is good at, the one step that makes its answers
reliable, and the two rules that keep your results and your data safe.
If you have never run the package by hand, start with [Your first
analysis](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/tutorial-00-first-analysis.md)
so you have a baseline to compare against.

## What it can – and cannot – do for you

An assistant is a fast, patient explainer and a first-draft writer. It
is not a substitute for running the analysis or for your own judgement.

**Good at**

- Explaining a step or a concept in plain language (“why is drift
  correction fitted on QC samples only?”).
- Drafting R code for your workflow, which you then run.
- Reading an R error message and suggesting a fix.
- Helping you plan an analysis from a description of your samples and
  standards.

**Not able to**

- Run your data or check that the numbers are right – only you can do
  that.
- Guarantee the code is correct; it can produce plausible code that
  fails.
- Know MRMhub’s functions reliably unless you show it the package’s own
  documentation first.

That last point is the one worth acting on, and it is easy.

## Make its answers accurate: show it the package’s own docs

Left to memory, an assistant invents function names that sound right but
do not exist – `normalize()` instead of
[`normalize_by_istd()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/normalize_by_istd.md),
or a single `run_pipeline()` that was never written. The fix is to give
it the package’s real reference and tell it to use only what it finds
there.

MRMhub publishes a compact map of its entire interface as a single file,
built automatically with the documentation site:

<https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/llms.txt>

Open that link, copy the contents into your chat, and start with an
instruction like this:

``` text
I am analysing targeted MS data in R with the package mrmhub. Below is the
package's function reference. Use ONLY functions that appear in it. If you are
unsure a function exists, say so rather than inventing one.

<paste the contents of https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/llms.txt here>
```

If your assistant can browse the web – Claude with web access, ChatGPT
with browsing – you can skip the copy-and-paste and simply give it the
link, asking it to read that page and follow the links to individual
function pages as needed.

## Common tasks

Each task below is a short prompt you can adapt. Paste the reference
first (or set it up once, further down) so the assistant is working from
the real interface.

### Understand a step

``` text
In one short paragraph, explain what correct_drift_loess() does and why drift
and batch corrections in mrmhub are fitted on QC samples, not study samples.
```

### Draft a script for your workflow

Ask for a complete script, and insist it keep MRMhub’s core pattern:
every processing step takes an `MRMhubExperiment` and returns an updated
one.

``` text
Write an R script using mrmhub that imports my data, normalises by internal
standard, corrects signal drift, quantifies against calibration curves,
computes QC metrics, filters failing features, and writes an Excel report.
Keep the mexp <- f(mexp, ...) pattern for every step, in recommended order.
```

A grounded assistant should return real function names in the right
order. The runnable core looks like the block below; it imports the
bundled demo so it works as is, and you would swap in your own file:

``` r

library(mrmhub)

# Bundled demo file, so this runs as written; use your own file instead
demo <- system.file("extdata", "MRMhub_demo.tsv", package = "mrmhub")

mexp <- MRMhubExperiment()
mexp <- import_data_mrmhub(mexp, path = demo, import_metadata = TRUE)

# Normalise each feature by its internal standard -> feature_norm_intensity
mexp <- normalize_by_istd(mexp)

# Write the multi-sheet Excel report
save_report_xlsx(mexp, path = "results.xlsx")
```

From that base, ask the assistant to add drift correction, calibration,
QC metrics, and filtering for your own data; the full pipeline and its
order are laid out in [Basic MRMhub
workflow](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/tutorial-02-basic-workflow.md).

### Explain and fix an error

Paste the error together with the line that produced it – the assistant
reads both far better than a description.

``` text
Running this line: mexp <- normalize_by_istd(mexp)
I get this error: <paste the exact error message>
What does it mean, and how do I fix it?
```

### Choose or understand a parameter

Point it at that function’s reference page, published alongside the map
above (for example `.../quant/reference/filter_features_qc.md`), and ask
what an argument controls and how to set it for your assay.

### Plan the analysis

``` text
My samples are plasma extracts with stable-isotope-labelled internal standards
and a 7-point external calibration curve. Which mrmhub steps apply, in what
order, and where do QC samples come in?
```

## Set it up once

If you use the assistant regularly, load the reference once instead of
pasting it into every chat. In **Claude**, create a Project and add the
`llms.txt` file (and a manual page or two) to its knowledge. In
**ChatGPT**, do the same with a Project or a custom GPT, attaching the
same files as knowledge. Every conversation in that Project is then
grounded in the real interface from the start.

## The no-code shortcut: `build_workflow()`

If you would rather not write R at all, the package gives the assistant
a head start.
[`build_workflow()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/build_workflow.md)
opens an interactive application: you point it at your data and
metadata, tick the processing steps you want, and it validates your
inputs and generates a correct, runnable Quarto (`.qmd`) workflow to
download (see [Build a workflow without
code](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/tutorial-12-workflow-builder.md)).

Handing that generated script to an assistant – to explain a step, or to
adjust one part – is far safer than asking it to write a pipeline from
nothing, because it starts from something already valid.

## Two rules you cannot skip

**Verify every AI-generated pipeline before trusting its results.**

- **Run it on data you understand** first – the bundled demo
  (`system.file("extdata", "MRMhub_demo.tsv", package = "mrmhub")`) is
  ideal. A made-up function fails immediately as “could not find
  function”.
- **Cross-check every function name** against the [function
  reference](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/index.md).
  If a call is not listed there, it does not exist, however convincing
  it looks.
- **Confirm the step order** and that drift and batch corrections are
  fitted on QC samples, not study samples. See [Design
  decisions](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/articles/manual-03-design-decisions.md)
  for why this matters.
- **Inspect the numbers**, not just that the script ran. A pipeline can
  complete and still be wrong. Sanity-check against QC plots and
  metrics.

**Do not paste study data into a cloud assistant.** Sample intensities,
subject metadata, and unpublished results sent to a hosted service leave
your control and may be retained. Share *code and the function map* –
`llms.txt`, reference pages, and the function calls themselves – never
the measurements. When the data must stay on the machine, use a locally
hosted model, which keeps everything on-device.

## Going further

More capable tooling exists for those who want it. Agentic coding
assistants such as Claude Code and Cursor operate directly on a project
folder and can read the package source as they write. Claude Desktop can
connect to your files through an MCP connector, though their contents
then reach the provider like any other message. Locally hosted models
(through Ollama or LM Studio) keep everything on-device, but a smaller
local model has memorised even less of a niche package, so it depends
*more* on being shown the reference, not less. Whichever you use, the
two rules above still apply.
