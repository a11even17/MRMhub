# Drift correction by cubic spline smoothing

This function corrects for run-order drifts within or across batches
using cubic spline smoothing. The correction is typically based on QC
(Quality Control) samples that are measured at specific intervals
throughout the run sequence. The smoothed curve derived from the QC
samples is then used to adjust all other samples in the dataset. The
correction can be applied to "intensity", "norm_intensity", or "conc"
data.

The cubic spline smoothing approach, particularly when used with the
regularization parameter `lambda`, is similar but not identical to
previously described QC-based drift correction methods, such as **QC-RSC
(Quality Control Regularized Spline Correction)**, described in Dunn et
al. (Nat Protoc, 2011) and Kirwan et al. (Anal Bioanal Chem, 2013).

By default, the smoothing parameter is determined using
cross-validation, which can lead to overfitting. To reduce overfitting
the regularization parameter `lambda` may be defined, with a good
starting point being `lambda = 0.01`. Additionally, the global smoothing
parameter can be specified via `spar`.

It is recommended to visually inspect the correction using the
[`plot_runscatter()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_runscatter.md)
function. Set the argument `recalc_trend_after = TRUE` so that the
trends after correction are also available for plotting. For further
details, refer to the description of
[`plot_runscatter()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_runscatter.md).

The corrections can be applied on a batch-by-batch basis
(`batch_wise = TRUE`, default) or across all batches
(`batch_wise = FALSE`). Existing corrections are either replaced
(`replace_previous = TRUE`) or added on top of them
(`replace_previous = FALSE`).

Furthermore, drift correction can be applied unconditionally
(`conditional_correction = FALSE`) or conditionally, based on whether
the sample CV change before and after correction is below a defined
threshold (`cv_diff_threshold`). This conditional correction is assessed
independently for each batch if `batch_wise = TRUE`, where the median of
the CV changes across the batch is compared with the threshold.

**Note**: The function outputs a message indicating the median CV change
and the median absolute CV before and after correction for all samples.
However, these metrics are experimental and should not be used as
definitive criteria for correction (see Details below).

This cubic spline method is implemented using the base R function
[`stats::smooth.spline()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/smooth.spline.html).

## Usage

``` r
correct_drift_cubicspline(
  data = NULL,
  variable,
  ref_qc_types,
  batch_wise = TRUE,
  ignore_istd = TRUE,
  replace_previous = TRUE,
  cv = TRUE,
  spar = NULL,
  lambda = NULL,
  penalty = 1,
  conditional_correction = FALSE,
  recalc_trend_after = FALSE,
  log_transform_internal = TRUE,
  feature_list = NULL,
  cv_diff_threshold = 0,
  use_original_if_fail = FALSE,
  show_progress = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  [`MRMhubExperiment`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/MRMhubExperiment-class.md)
  object

- variable:

  The variable to be corrected for drift effects. Must be one of
  "intensity", "norm_intensity", or "conc"

- ref_qc_types:

  QC types used for drift correction

- batch_wise:

  Logical. Apply the correction to each batch separately (`TRUE`,
  default) or across all batches (`FALSE`).

- ignore_istd:

  Logical. Exclude internal standards (ISTDs) from correction if `TRUE`.

- replace_previous:

  Logical. Replace existing correction (`TRUE`, default) or layer on top
  of it (`FALSE`).

- cv:

  Ordinary leave-one-out (`TRUE`) or ‘generalized’ cross-validation
  (GCV) when `FALSE`; is used for smoothing parameter computation only
  when spar is not specified

- spar:

  Smoothing parameter for cubic spline smoothing. If not specified or
  `NULL`, the smoothing parameter is computed using the specified cv
  method. Typically (but not necessarily) (0,1\].

- lambda:

  Regularization parameter for cubic spline smoothing. Default is
  `NULL`, which means no regularization.

- penalty:

  The coefficient of the penalty for degrees of freedom in the GCV
  criterion.

- conditional_correction:

  Determines whether drift correction is applied to all features
  unconditionally (`FALSE`, the default) or, when `TRUE`, only
  conditionally based on sample CV change.

- recalc_trend_after:

  Recalculate trend post-drift correction for
  [`plot_runscatter()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/plot_runscatter.md).
  This will double calculation time.

- log_transform_internal:

  Log transform the data for correction when `TRUE` (the default). Note:
  log transformation is solely applied internally for smoothing, results
  will not be log-transformed.

- feature_list:

  Subset the features for correction whose names match the specified
  text using regular expression. Default is `NULL`.

- cv_diff_threshold:

  Maximum allowable change (difference) in CV before and after smoothing
  for correction to be applied.

- use_original_if_fail:

  Determines the action when smoothing fails or results in invalid
  values for a feature. If `FALSE` (default), the result for each
  feature will be `NA` for all batches, if `TRUE`, the original data is
  kept.

- show_progress:

  Logical. Display progress bars if `TRUE`; disable for notebook
  rendering by setting to `FALSE`.

## Value

[`MRMhubExperiment`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/MRMhubExperiment-class.md)
object

## Details

In the output message, the median CV change is computed as the median of
CV changes for all features in global correction or for features where
the correction passed the defined CV difference threshold in case of
conditional correction (`conditional_correction = TRUE`). For batch-wise
correction, the change is calculated per batch, with the final median CV
change being the median of these batch medians across features.
