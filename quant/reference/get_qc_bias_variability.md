# Retrieve QC bias and variability metrics

This function retrieves quality control (QC) bias and variability
metrics from a `MRMhubExperiment` object. It returns a summary of QC
metrics for specified QC samples, including bias, absolute bias, and
intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV). The standard deviation of the
concentration ratio is also included unless it is `NA` for all analytes,
i.e. when no replicates were measured.

## Usage

``` r
get_qc_bias_variability(
  data,
  qc_types = NA,
  sample_ids = NA,
  wide_format = "none",
  include_qualifier = FALSE,
  with_conc = TRUE,
  with_conc_target = TRUE,
  with_bias = TRUE,
  with_bias_abs = FALSE,
  with_conc_ratio = FALSE,
  with_cv_intra = TRUE,
  with_conc_out_of_range = TRUE,
  summary_table = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A
  [`MRMhubExperiment`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/MRMhubExperiment-class.md)
  object containing the dataset and necessary annotations for
  calibration analysis.

- qc_types:

  A character vector specifying the QC types to include in the results,
  in addition to `CAL`. If not specified, all applicable QC types are
  included by default.

- sample_ids:

  A character vector specifying the sample IDs to include in the
  results. If not specified, all analyses regardless of their sample IDs
  are included by default.

- wide_format:

  Format of the output table. Must be one of `"none"`, `"features"`, or
  `"samples"`. If `"none"`, the output is in long format. If
  `"features"`, the output is in wide format with features as columns.
  If `"samples"`, the output is in wide format with samples as columns.

- include_qualifier:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, includes qualifier features in the results.
  Defaults to `FALSE`.

- with_conc:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, includes target and measured mean concentrations
  in the results. Defaults to `TRUE`.

- with_conc_target:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, includes target (known) concentration of the QC
  sample in the results. Defaults to `TRUE`.

- with_bias:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, includes percentage bias in the results. Defaults
  to `TRUE`.

- with_bias_abs:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, includes absolute bias in concentration units in
  the results. Defaults to `FALSE`.

- with_conc_ratio:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, includes the ratio of measured to target
  concentration in the results. Defaults to `FALSE`.

- with_cv_intra:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, includes intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV)
  in the results. Defaults to `TRUE`.

- with_conc_out_of_range:

  Logical. If `TRUE` (and the dataset carries the
  `feature_conc_out_of_range` flag from
  [`quantify_by_calibration()`](https://slinghub.github.io/MRMhub/quant/reference/quantify_by_calibration.md)),
  includes the fraction of replicate measurements whose concentration
  fell outside the calibrated range (`frac_conc_out_of_range`). Defaults
  to `TRUE`.

- summary_table:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, round the numeric metric columns to 3 significant
  figures for display (the integer replicate count `n` is left intact).
  This is a presentation view for reporting; the values are **rounded**,
  so do not use it for downstream computation. Defaults to `FALSE`
  (full, unrounded metrics).

## Value

A data frame containing the calibration results, including metrics such
as bias, percentage bias, and intra-assay CV based on specified
parameters.

## Details

The standard deviation of concentration is also included unless the
number of replicates was 1.

The function uses data from the `MRMhubExperiment` object and filters it
according to the specified QC types and other parameters. It then
calculates summary statistics for each feature, such as bias and CV, and
organizes the data into a user-specified format.
